## Transcript

[00:00:02] **JOHN:** Everyone, welcome to your interstellar broadcast of Last Best Hope. My name is John, and I'm here with Josh.

[00:00:09] **JOSH:** Hi, everybody.

[00:00:10] **JOHN:** Today, we're going to be discussing, we're going to be jumping ahead a little bit, we're not going to go completely chronologically, the season finale of season 2 Babylon 5, called The Fall of Night. Uh, it's an episode that seems oddly, not only prescient, but to be lining up to current events in real time today.

Uh, and it features, uh, the way much of the show does, uh, a wrap up of an entire season of plot threads. Uh, it happens always around New Year's on the show. Um, and it deals with major intergalactic political ramifications. Um, but I think as we break it down, it's, it's going to be hard not to deny some of the parallels to our own 20th century history, I think, which was intended in the writing, um, and which obviously wasn't intended, is the parallels to what's happening in our modern day world, uh, focusing on what's happening in the U.

S. and Europe today. So, Um, to start that off, um, I'm listening to where the episode begins, which was pretty much just a, uh, it seemed like a regular episode starting off with the training exercise with Sheridan out on his own, training the, uh, the pilots of Babylon 5 for specific maneuvers against the Centauri, uh, potential Centauri aggressors, because for this entire season, the Centauri have flipped their role From season one as the sort of empire and decline past decline that now the aid of the shadows, they not only struck back at the Narn, but completely obliterated their home world and, you know, invaded, uh, and have enslaved and conquered the Narn, uh, for the second time in, in the history of this world.

Um, So Sheridan is rightfully suspicious of and worried about the Centauri and what they might be up to because they've begun to flex their muscle. They are, uh, uh, annexing worlds from the Non Aligned, League of Non Aligned Worlds, uh, you know, here and there, uh, but being very quiet about it, denying that it ever happened.

And then when it's proven that they did annex a world, saying, well, we needed that for our security, uh, it's definitely, you know, that is classic, you know, That was World War Two, that was the lead up to that, Liebensraum, we just need some breathing space. Oh, don't worry about, we're not gonna come too close to you.

And the way Londo portrays that throughout the season, uh, of, oh, don't worry about us, I'll be diplomatic, and then tirades of anger, really well done. Again, I, I think Londo might be one of the, you know, just, he captures every aspect of this show. Um,

[00:02:49] **Speaker 2:** Well, 

[00:02:49] **JOSH:** you know, there's a reason, why in the gathering, in the pilot, he's the one who gives the very first voiceover that starts off the whole series, the whole saga. Uh, because you're right. Uh, Londo in a lot of ways is sort of, the encapsulation of all of the themes of B5.

[00:03:07] **JOHN:** he really is. And given his, you know, ultimate fate. I think it ended appropriately. With certain quietness regarding that character or that obviously too many spoilers, but this is not a spoiler free show, um, it really was, you know, just sort of a general intro, but we knew something was up with the Centauri, uh, we're worried about that and we weren't thinking about the greater issues at this point as the episode goes on, um, and it seems like we get some good news, uh, despite all the rumblings that seem really clear that Things are happening on Earth, that there's a slide into authoritarianism, President Clark has been up to a lot, they had evidence presented from the, uh, the doctor as to, there was no mysterious illness, the Vice President deliberately left, there are all kinds of shenanigans that, General Haig has been there, so we know, by the finale, we know what's what, we know that there are very dark forces on Earth, uh, at this point Sheridan is aware of the shadows, um, you have In the Shadow of Zaha Doom, so this is, a huge amount has happened in this season, so And the characters really are up to date on what's happening, uh, uh, on that front, and they're hoping for the best still on Earth, and that's, and that's sort of the vibe at the beginning of this, is that we have all these warnings, it really doesn't look good, but there's still a lot of hope that, you know, we haven't fallen yet into this, um, and a representative from Earth, Frederick Lance, arrives on Babylon 5, a very kindly seeming, Old man, you know, older man, uh, with his attache, who's the suspicious one.

This is the guy, this is his partner in crime, who's the head of the Ministry of Peace. And we'll get to that word later, uh, what peace means in this episode. But there it is, the Ministry of Peace, under which the Night Watch organization, uh, falls. So he's there to oversee, you know, and check out how Night Watch is doing on Babylon 5.

And Lance is there to investigate the Centauri situation. Um, and the crew of Babylon 5 is very excited. They really, they really, you know, they think finally, uh, Earth is going to do something. And when G'Kar, the, uh, uh, free citizen, no longer a representative of the Norn outside of his influence over the, uh, other, uh, rebel and free Norn on Babylon 5, Um, here's this, and he's elated.

He says, Earth is finally going to take a stand. And that's sort of what's telegraphed from that initial meeting with Lance and the Babylon 5 command staff is that he's here, the Earth is finally going to do something. And talk about building up your hopes for that. Um, what was your sense, like, when you first see Lance come on board the station?

[00:05:54] **JOSH:** involved, and, it's so interesting because obviously we watched this show the first time 30 years ago. Um, as much younger people. so, I wish that I could recall how effective that was for me then. because I think it's also like, it's not just that.

we have grown and matured, but also I think we have another 30 years of media savvy and understanding how TV works. So in some ways, I feel like someone watching this now would be like, this is too good to be true. 

[00:06:29] **JOHN:** You might you you might be right.

You know, you try to remember those, you know, that, that 30 year experience. And I certainly have moments from the big epic parts of this show. Um, but yeah, I mean, re rewatching it, he felt one thing I'll say about the show is that I always enjoyed.

The, um, the day players as there's record, you know, the actors who came in for one or two episodes, they were usually actors you hadn't seen either for a while or in very much other stuff. And they seemed very unique to Babylon 5, or they were like sort of famous old time actors you really haven't seen in a while.

And this guy gave off, he had exactly what I think they intended to portray was he seemed like a. Yeah. Like 1930s style European diplomat, even though he's from Earth and was more, you know. Americanized in that sense. Um, he really seemed like that. And, and obviously I would think they're going to be parallels to Neville Chamberlain and things like that based on what happens.

But, and for context for the listeners, you know, what had happened on Narn is what we would certainly call, I mean, I don't know even if the word, genocide is too weak for what the Centauri did to the Narn homeworld. Mass drivers driving the entire planet. into dust, uh, killing, you know, a population that I don't, I don't remember what they said, but it was in the millions.

Um, and then taking them over. It wasn't just a military invasion occupation. This was obliteration, a destruction of everything they had, and then occupying them. They were in the honor of a completely broken people by this point. I think by any standard, it was considered an atrocity. And Londo himself is on board, I think, as the, uh, Valyrian.

Is, is the name of the ship, uh, that he watches the mass drivers, which is, you know, just basically mini asteroids being hurled at the planet. Um, uh, it's like, you know, nukes with without the fallout is basically what that means. So the level of atrocity here is really important to put in context. So the other worlds are rightfully terrified of the Centura because they've just crossed all the lines. All the lines of war, all the lines of of ethics, you know, anything that there might have been a shred left, they they blew past all of it. So in theory, you'd expect Earth would say something to object to that, because it's in their own interest, you know what? They don't want that happening to anybody in the Earth Alliance.

Um. So, you do get this kindly seeming guy, and he's very hopeful seeming. There are lines he has about creating a world of peace for his grandchildren, that he leaves a legacy. His dialogue there is very specific, though. It's very much about him. It's very how you imagine a sort of egotistical, ambassador or, representative to be.

He talked about, I want to leave him a legacy from the old man. That's the line. And I think, oh, okay, so he's making it about him. Um, and, and, and that can obviously, I think that leads to where his view gets colored. So the episode goes on and, um, he, he's there to, we don't know exactly what for, but he meets with every other world's representatives and ambassadors while he's there.

So again, it's a real good head fake out because you think that Well, why would he be meeting all these people? Um, He must be trying to assess intelligence and information and figure out who might be a good ally, who's going to stand up with Earth, et cetera, et cetera, and meets with everybody. Um, and the interviews seem reasonable from what we're shown on camera.

Uh, and then, you know, G'Kar

[00:10:18] **JOSH:** he meets with everybody.

[00:10:20] **JOHN:** And, he meets with every

[00:10:21] **JOSH:** with everyone with one exception.

[00:10:23] **JOHN:** Right. And, and, and G'Kar is not an ambassador. He's not an official representative. Or anything like that, but the crew, of course, say, you know, Oh yeah, you should meet with him. Like, of course, he's here.

Why wouldn't you? And mention it to Lance, and that's where we get it. That's the moment that it happens. You see his, oh, oh, because they have him, meet him in the hallway. He goes, uh, uh, I, I, I can't, um, I don't have time right now. Sorry, uh, nice to meet you. Uh, go, go, go, goodbye. That, that stuttering awkwardness and shock, that was to the viewer, wait.

Something's not, something's really wrong here. That's not how he would have react, he should react. And that's when the pieces start to fall into place because it's only, you know, a beat after that, that he finds out about Sheridan's maneuvers and calls him out and says, you're endangering everything.

That's when the viewer can really 

together.

[00:11:11] **JOSH:** you know what's interesting about that from what you just said? He said, you are endangering everything I've worked for, right? So, I really think that you're on to something with that observation. And I also think, that observation dovetails with something, that I wanted to mention with, Mr. Wells, his attache, who, by the way, maybe it's because we were just talking about him last week, but I kind of got Mr. Morden vibes from Mr. Wells, the way that uh, that scene with Ivanova, he basically asks her, what do you want? the personal ambition that they can take advantage of to get her to do what they want And I thought that was really interesting because, and unfortunately I think I have this insight so close to the surface because of things that we're seeing in our own government.

But like, that's how you get this sort of compliance, right? Like, you, play to the personal ambitions of people. You give them something that they want, and then they're able to rationalize in so many different ways, their position or why they're doing what they're doing. And it's not the worst thing in the world, it's just you know, and they can even have like, plausible self deniability of saying like, well, if it's not me, it'll be somebody else, might as well be me, right?

but the way that dovetails into what you just said about, how Lance makes everything about him, like, that's how they see the world. They see it as transactional. 

[00:12:39] **Speaker 4:** Silence.

[00:12:41] **JOSH:** you know, Trumpian view of things. Where Trump is sort of the extreme where that transactional nature of everything essentially, like that is what he understands to the exclusion of all other motivations. Like, I don't think he can even, how somebody may. Do something for reasons other than self interest. get what you want and how to accumulate and consolidate power that is completely about. playing to personal ambitions of people and, you know, we're really lucky or the, crew of Babylon 5 is really lucky that, know, generally speaking, the command staff of B5. do have other motivations for why they are serving, right?

I thought it was very savvy of Ivanova, like she immediately understood what was going on here, what Wells was saying, like, sounded a little fishy. but also, like, doesn't sound terrible?

even ways where you can, justify it and make it sound like it's a good thing, I won't betray a confidence or sell out my ideals like she knew that this seeming innocuous sort of arrangement that Wells was proposing here was the first step on the road that goes

[00:14:14] **Speaker 3:** And we see what happens with, uh, Zach at the same time. Where, where it's a different power dynamic because Ivanova is already more established both in her career and her sense of self. Zack has portrayed his character low ranking and isn't really sure of himself, um, at this point in the show. Um, and he figures, he's asked to do something even less, in a sense, to him.

You know, just, oh, did this guy say something somewhat, you know, complained about taxes as a small businessman? on Babylon 5 and, you know, can you, can you confirm this? It's like, well, I guess he did complain. It's like, oh, that wasn't very hard, was it? Those two scenes are, are, are the same, but you're looking at how you appeal to both different levels of, of people in the command structure and how you manipulate people. Ivanova's reaction Um, that actually fascinated me because I, in my memory, would have thought, knowing, you know, what we think of as Ivanova as a character, would have had a fiery response. And instead, it was this incredibly diplomatic, calculated, strong response of a strong no, but she wasn't going to try to infuriate him.

Or she, she realized what a what a, what a landmine this was. And also that she didn't need to reveal herself as necessarily too sympathetic to the other side, uh, in, in this case, to just politely decline and indicate that was not in line with how she behaved and sort of put it back on him. And his response as a result wasn't, you'll regret this.

Well, the offers open indefinitely, you know, which was also very Mr. Morden love, you know, so, so, so that, that, that her character knew how to handle that moment without setting off too many alarm bells with Mr. Wells. And it left that dangling bit of hope for Mr. Wells that, well, the door could still be reopened in the future.

Something along those lines and this and this prevented her from coming under immediate suspicion or at least too much suspicion I think the whole b5 staff was obviously under suspicion And you're talking about the commands of having gone through this, you know The way they wrote Sheridan in the season one is he episode one season two Was that it was a last minute appointment by the president should something happen to him or something happened to the previous commander?

And because of the you know behind the scenes stuff that's what gets changed But I thought it was interesting that they established sheridan from the beginning as somebody who operates From conscience and duty above almost all else. And that the, that the, uh, uh, you know, uh, uh, slain president wanted to make sure somebody like that was in charge of Babylon 5.

Uh, so obviously we're establishing these are who these characters are. This, this is what they are in certain hope in a modern world. What we have, those people in those similar positions now, um. But their, their tricks may not have worked on them, but it was, it was an eerie sort of, uh, B or C plot to this episode where we said, oh, oh, this Nightwatch stuff is not good because by the end of the episode, we see the consequences of it.

You see that when Zach, uh, confirms just a little rumor about somebody complaining about the government, the shop is shut down. The guy is, we assume, arrested, um, and a sign goes up, Ministry of Peace shuts down this business, uh, under, you know, uh, uh, because of sedition. And you said, Oh, okay. So that one little comment and just a confirmation, uh, and getting somebody locked in and now Zach is going to feel guilty about that.

But weirdly enough, that kind of guilt doesn't move somebody away from participating in. Something like Nightwatch, which is, is equivalent to, I mean, it's, it's not just, it's not just when we think of World War II, it's, it's, it's just as much analogous to Stasi and, and East Germany where everyone became a spy on each other, you know, speak out if you see something, uh, um, and, and, and report, you know, your, your, your neighbor, report anybody for anything suspicious, um, And that, that move, you'd think, would, would turn him off to it, and it did turn Zach off to a point, but the more that kind of fear gets reinforced, I think the more likely somebody would be to do that again, because they realize, oh, that's going to come back at me if I don't play ball, continue to play ball, so we obviously see in season three how that plays out, how, uh, how he has to make his decisions, uh, Gariboldi has to deal with that, you know, it's very telling, but it's these little, um, Little actions that can matter as much as the big ones, because obviously this episode has.

The big ones on the, you know, on the Centauri Norn Earth axis, but this was, this was a real important aspect to have in there too, because it's really easy to lose sight of, well, that's the quote from Sheridan, uh, I think later on is, it's easy to lose sight of the big, you know, if you lose sight of the small ideals, how do you have the big ones? Um, this show is always about, we're going to show you the small ones and the big ones. You said in our previous episode that JMS realized that this was a space opera intergalactic political drama. And a personal sci fi story, and actually the two are the same thing. And so we always get both those things happening in parallel in this, and that, that happened here.

And as the episode goes on, I, I, I just. I had a little bit of chills. I was thinking, oh, this can't be, this can't be what I think it is. This can't be going where I think it is. Um, I think I told you before we started recording that, um, I'd actually watched this episode, um, before this week's news came out.

Um, regarding, uh, the negotiations between Russia and the U. S. regarding Ukraine. seeing that news unfold, and then having only a day or two previous, I've watched this episode. Uh, I, I sort of laughed darkly, like you gotta be kidding me, is somebody, is somebody just reading a playbook of what to do and, and, and follow down sort of the, you know, the, you know, how to be, uh, uh, almost a, how to call it, like a comic book totalitarian, like you're just following a plot line, you're not even deviating from it. 

[00:20:49] **JOSH:** this, particular authoritarian, power grab that, we are living through is happening is that, these are cartoon villains.

they are so, Transparent, and mustache twirling, caricatures of what you would expect the real thing to be like. to the point if you were writing this, you would get notes about how unrealistic it was, like, you know, and I think I said last time, when I revisited the show in the early 2000s, I kind of thought, you know, maybe B5 is a little heavy handed, right?

[00:21:21] **Speaker 4:** Yeah.

[00:21:22] **JOSH:** And, given the reality of what we're living through and what we're seeing and how it's really playing out. It's not heavy handed. it's not heavy handed at all.

[00:21:31] **Speaker 4:** Now.

[00:21:32] **JOSH:** You know, and you were saying that it was as if they were reading from a script or like a, prescribed, of some kind.

And I do think that it reveals There are some, not intrinsic, but like, through some combination of forces, historical, political, similar dynamics end up, playing out. Like, what is, the quote, um, history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes,

[00:21:57] **Speaker 4:** Yeah, I've heard that.

[00:21:58] **JOSH:** right? so, and it was interesting, like, when this was written.

The early 1990s, the freshest or most, top of mind examples of, this authoritarian, situation, the two examples that are, were most top of mind then were, Germany in the 1930s and some aspects of the Soviet Union.

and so you mentioned before, the illusions here

mostly, referencing those things. So you were talking about, Mr. Lance, who, by the way, that actor, the only other thing I've ever seen him in, uh, was, uh, the first episode of, space 1999, he plays a very similar character.

[00:22:33] **Speaker 4:** Interesting.

[00:22:34] **JOSH:** and I know that, JMS was a big fan of, British TV, so I almost wonder if, you know, he saw his, headshot and was like, that guy, I want to get that guy, because he had seen him in Space 1999. that's another side.

you said, there are shades of, Neville Chamberlain. He literally says, we shall know. time, which is a direct, Chamberlain quote, and then in the closing, Uh, when Ivanova has that, 

[00:22:59] **Speaker 4:** Yeah.

[00:23:01] **JOSH:** there's a shot of, Londo in the council chamber, where he's like, very physical, like very emphatic, and he's shaking with rage.

Yeah, and I think it was on, JMS did a commentary for this episode on the season 2 DVD set, I think that's where I'm getting this from, but that, performance, Peter Jarosik. was watching, videos of, Hitler's speeches.

[00:23:23] **Speaker 4:** Interesting. Interesting. That

[00:23:26] **JOSH:** So when it was a direct, yeah, so it was, a direct sort of, visual allusion,

to once again, like, that, memory of Nazi Germany. in the early 90s, that was still in living memory, right? the generation that, lived it is almost completely gone. So, I did have the thought, I know JMS wrote, pilot for a proposed, reboot of Babylon 5, and it makes me wonder how he would have handled these same themes with 30 more years of history in hindsight.

[00:23:59] **JOHN:** Yeah, I mean, you have, you're right about the living memory and the fact that because it was both living memory and because it was, it was victory by the allied forces, access was broken, you know, the, well, I should say not the, it was, you know, it was, Germany and Japan were effectively broken and rebuilt, unlike the First World War, they were, they were rebuilt, incorporated into the world.

Uh, when the Soviet Union falls, uh, as we referred to before, it was considered, yeah, yeah, the Francis Fukushima idea, the end of history, this is how it's going to be. Democracy, particularly what we call liberal democracy, meaning preserving rights over, um, even majoritarian rule in democracies, is the way to go in the future.

So Whenever a writer or an academic, um, were, you know, or a commentator on the news was to bring up, Oh, well, that's like fascism. Oh, that's like authoritarianism. They were immediately looked at and say, Oh, hold your horses on that. That's not, it's like, we had that, we defeated it. It was almost like, we can never go back to it because we defeated it.

And again, living memory, we defeated it. That doesn't come back. We won. And you're now exaggerating something. And, and as a result, weakening your argument. So for a very long time, if somebody made a comparison, Let's outright say if you compare it compared to somebody to the Germans of World War II, uh, you compare them to Hitler They were saying well, you've just lost intellectual debate.

I was told that in school I was told that college that you the moment you bring that up It's like you've just given up the argument because you went so far over the top It's not saying people don't argue over the top the the weird thing about that is it nullified the ability to objectively examine history and that it wasn't I use the word magical.

It's not an academic term, but people think of the Second World War as As magic or fantasy, that it was so out of reality, it must have required these very unique circumstances, it was this particular villain in the form of Adolf Hitler, a particular series of things, and it was the evil, evil Germans who must have followed him, realizing, no, no, no, no, even right after that, you have Hannah Arden, you know, talking about, banality of evil, the simplicity of just everybody going along to get along, there was nothing particularly super powerful, super unique, certainly not magical or fantastic about him, even though he was very occult interested.

And we, we've made that up in the way we teach our history as if this is an inaccessible thing to us, and that it's almost an oddity of history. Uh, when in fact the only way to prevent authoritarianism is to look at it through a very clear eyed rational perspective and say, this happened very simply and relatively easily and can happen again.

We've all heard it. The price of, of freedom is eternal vigilance. Well, we've been. We've dropped the ball on that for decades now, and we did it in part by denying the fact that we can argue parallels, because the rest of the world outside of our sort of U. S. bubble here has had many strongman authoritarians, um, all over the world, many as a result of actions that were taken internationally by the world's superpowers, the Soviet Union and the U.

S. throughout the 20th century. So we have examples all throughout the 20th century, in the beginning of the 21st century, and again, everybody's sort of like, But no, don't look at that. So I think even in writing like Babylon 5, it was seen as, okay, if you make those references, you can be seen almost as too alarmist.

Um, I think he just went in full speed to this and said, okay, in our 200 year future, um, this scenario like the 1930s and 40s is unfolding again. And that was seen as acceptable because it's, 200 years in the future. It's way out there. It's a fantasy world of a station in space. Like it's just separate enough that no one's going to quite, uh, argue that, that, that you're being too hyperbolic or too crazy about it.

Um, and that's, that, that I think is the big message we need to take here is that no, no, no, it's, that's never the case. We actually always need to be studying this. And that's, I think why this show is one of these examples that does parallel because it wasn't It wasn't, uh, doing something unique to itself in terms of history, it was unique in that I portrayed it without trying to filter it for a modern audience and saying, Oh, but that would never happen here.

That's the phrase. It would never happen 

[00:28:26] **Speaker 4:** here.

[00:28:27] **JOSH:** No, yeah, I mean, there is certainly a way that, we treated and still treat, the Second World War as, It's, you know, some sort of aberration instead of, something that's, uh, you know, the dynamics of play, replicate themselves and occur, I think, with more regularity than, we're comfortable with, uh, that we're comfortable acknowledging, and, uh, there was something I read the other day, uh, someone on social media, I forget what exactly they said, but it was, something that's sort of like a genre, or, uh, of tweet, in, the Trump era, something to the effect of, like, if you ever wondered how you would react.

in 1930s Germany when, Hitler was rising to power, you know,

now exactly how you would react.

[00:29:09] **Speaker 6:** Silence. 

[00:29:10] **JOSH:** And the same way that I think the tendency to, villainize

[00:29:15] **Speaker 6:** Silence. 

[00:29:15] **JOSH:** dehumanize everyday Germans, as somehow particularly, monstrous, somehow, I think is a mistake, because I think, you know, as we are seeing, the thing is,

just heard somebody say this, the other day and I wish I could remember who it was.

saying that, what allows them to

eyed about what's happening right now and not, fall prey to the trap of authoritarianism and fascism and, going MAGA, like, he was positing that the difference between him and MAGA people is that he acknowledges that he has the capacity within himself to, become, you know, a Nazi the way that, great horrors because, it was all done in their name and maybe some of them didn't like it, but like, what were they to do? 

[00:30:15] **Speaker 3:** that? That's a really important point, though, is the most, the most uncomfortable thing I think and has, and has, I feel my, my body's tense and just thinking about that because I want to react to say, no, that's not possible.

[00:30:27] **Speaker 4:** It goes against what we're 

[00:30:29] **Speaker 3:** taught, you know, that, that, that's possible. I think. The, one of the wisest things a person can, can realize is that that capacity was profoundly human. It wasn't, uh, it wasn't unique to a people, to a culture, to a part of the world. It wasn't, again, it wasn't this idea of there are a few evil people, a few good people in the world, and that's how history always plays out.

So I, I really, it's a, it's a difficult place to go and for a commentator like that, or, or, you know, somebody quoting that saying, no, I see where that could be in me. That's a, that, that's a form of self examination, self awareness that I think few of us even have, is to say, hey, I see where that could have happened to me, because obviously it happened to millions and millions and millions of people.

In 1930s, Germany, and there's so much literature out there on how that happened. And most people are not, uh, uh, educated on that because it's very, very uncomfortable to realize that we all are a couple of steps away, depending on the circumstances, and if we don't realize what's happening. Or we don't want to realize what's happening.

And I love what you said that, you know, this is the time you said, well, how would we have reacted if we were in 19, uh, uh, 32 or 33 or any of those years? And this will show a lot of people, but the important part, which this show to, to very quickly jump all the way ahead, because it is television.

Eventually the good guys win, but it doesn't happen in a way where it's just good guys win, we go home, credits roll, celebrate, happily, happily lived after. It's a very difficult process, but what's said in the end after this was not a process of demonization of those who followed President Clark, those who followed orders at all.

In fact, it's a complete reconciliation of saying. What you did was wrong. And they even accused Sheridan of like saying, well, the way you came back at it was also wrong. There's no right, there's no easy way to adjudicate that. But the point is afterwards not to say, oh, but I'm so much better than you because I, I was on the side that freed us from President Clark.

It was a recognition of that core humanity saying, but very easily, I could have found myself on the other side. And I think realizing that in times like now say, okay, there isn't this chasm between. Uh, uh, the sides in this country and that means that it doesn't excuse anybody's behavior, but it means, oh, you can understand why it's happening.

Uh, you can see how tempting and easy it is to fall into. Um, and that's again, the slow buildup, this, this is happening over multiple seasons. This wasn't a story where, you know, season one, incredibly slow on, I mean, season wasn't slow, but it was only morsels of the story. Season two ramps it up. You still think.

We're going to get there. We're going to save the day. This won't happen. It does at the end, that's the recognition of, oh, it is the people who you thought are just regular everyday people who fall in line with that regime, and that's, and that's sort of what you see in this episode, whether it's Zach, whether it's the rest, and then which we'll get to in a minute, is, uh, these Nightwatch spies, uh, ratting out Captain Sheridan and the Narn refugee vessel.

Um, and I think, uh, it's a good point to take a quick break and we'll come back with, uh, with the heavy hitting stuff from this episode. I think we've had a lot of good buildup and, oof, this, this, Once, once the agreement is announced, once we find out what Frederick Lance was there to do, and when the Narn refugees show up, oh, this, the whole show takes a different tone,

so. 

[00:34:11] **JOHN:** Let's dive right back into the episode and really the meat of it, where it gets going now and where the parallels come in you get to the middle of the episode and you're, you're beginning to suspect something's not right. Obviously with Nightwatch there, you're like, okay, we know it's not right. And a Narn cruiser comes through the jump gate. They're crippled. They've been, they were in deep space when the home world of the Narn was bombed and the fleets were destroyed by the Shadows and the Centauri.

And they've been limping along ever since trying to survive and Babylon 5 following the laws of the Earth Alliance, uh, is going to give refuge to help resupply and give medical aid to, you know, basically so energy for their jump drives and medical aid for their, uh, uh, crew. and, and Sheridan realizing the nature of the Centauri and, and, and this conflict as it's larger says, wait, we have to hide this because if, if, if it leaks out from station, of course, and there are millions of points that can leak out or hundreds of tens of thousands based on the number of people who live there, they can, uh, you know, the Centauri would show up, uh, and they would not recognize the neutrality of that space.

So he gives them aid. And it seemed like, okay, this is our heroes doing the heroic thing, this is what you expect of Babylon 5, and you feel bad for the Narns, and they're gonna hopefully be able to get off on their own and go, you know, on to another day, uh, at least as a few free Narns would be. It's a Nightwatch member in command, uh, who overhears what's, you know, obviously is part of what's happening and reports it to Mr. Wells directly. And this is, this is meant to be after the scene with Zach Allen, where she's also there like, okay, this is very interesting. And you see her expression, um, in C& C like, oh, I better, I think this is something of note that Mr.

Wells wants to know. And again, she's not a, she's not meant to be a villain. She's meant to be. Yep, she's in on it. She, she believes in the Night Watch and is a member and will report that to her supervisors. So Lance shows up furious, much more so than about the. maneuvers earlier, uh, and is absolutely freaking out and reveals everything that we are here to make a non aggression pact with the Centauri.

We are not going to call them out on their atrocities. We are not going to, uh, come to the aid or at least draw a line in the sand, uh, where the other non aligned worlds can stand to stop Centauri aggression. No, we are going to enter into a non aggression treatment, uh, agreement that enables the Centauri to continue their war of expansion and leave Earth safe. The crew is aghast and that immediately puts a threat, uh, keeping this ship secret because that was, you know, they'd just been ordered to depower their, or asked to depower their jump drive in order to finish repairs. And there it is, because Nightwatch is aware of it, the station leaks. The Centauri show up, and the big, moment of the episode, the climax occurs, a massive space battle, Babylon 5 has upgraded weaponry, uh, due to the events of the first season, and the increased perception of, you know, what the Centauri are doing, the threats to, to the station itself, and tensions rise and rise, what are the Centauri going to do, what's Babylon 5 going to do, and how do you get, and Terrence is like, no, we, we gave them aid, We gave them aid.

We will, we will make sure that they are safe when they're in our space, when they're in our jurisdiction. Once they're through the jump gate and past our jurisdiction, that's not our problem. We can't, we have no authority over that, but they will not be harmed in front of us. It's a classic hero moment.

Sheridan saying like, You're not gonna, You're not gonna punch somebody in the face in front of me. You're not gonna kill somebody in front of me. And the Centauri don't even acknowledge Babylon 5. They basically just start firing at the Narn and the station. That was a surprise that you think like, Oh, there's gonna be a diplomatic.

Back and forth. No, they just fire first. Uh, and they, you know, just, and the station gets, it's still like, uh, uh,

[00:38:26] **JOSH:** Mandible.

[00:38:27] **JOHN:** mandible is, is, is, is almost worked off. And, Sheridan's just like, and he's angry. He's like, fire back, defend us. You know, like we have to do, we have to do, and. I love how in this show, this, this, this is that, you know, nature of the sci fi combat, attempting for little bits of realism, but drama in the moment too.

You don't know how your weapons are going to be. This isn't the target phasers on their engines only, just disable them, it'll be fine moment. This is We're Firing Back. We hope to only disable them, but we have to fire every, these are everything we've got. The station unleashes, we, we, we get this big CG moment for that episode, and one of the best up until that point. And, they do disable the Centauri ship, and then some. And they realize very quickly how bad the damage is, scramble the medical ships, there's not enough time. And the Centauri ship blows up in front of them. The horror on everyone's faces. was palpable. It was, oh, not only is this a humanitarian disaster because they didn't want to kill the Centauri, the, the weight of that in terms of the diplomatic interactions, what that meant for, could mean for the future, was huge.

And that was What do you sort of expect of other heroes in the show?

[00:39:43] **JOSH:** when Sheridan says to scramble the medical ships, there's still time, and then Ivanova's like, no, it's too late. And Sheridan realizes that it's about to blow up, he goes, Oh my god. Do you think, in that moment, he's thinking of the political fallout?

Or, all of the people who he just murdered? Or not?

[00:40:01] **JOHN:** I, my, my initial reaction is I think he's thinking about the people.

[00:40:07] **JOSH:** Yeah. Same.

[00:40:08] **JOHN:** how, and that's, that's how he was as a character. I think Bruce Boxleitner did such a brilliant job at portraying this because he comes in, in the first episode of the season, and they tell you his history. He was the one who, uh, you know, blew up the only Mimbari cruiser in the Earth Mimbari War.

Um, and he never celebrates it as a victory for the sake of, oh, I was able to beat them. He takes this very philosophical approach of We are trying to save ourselves. I found a way to finally beat a ship. And he, and he has no compunction that it was, uh, did Mabari, are I right? That he was dishonorable by mining a land, by mining asteroids to take out the ship, but it wasn't a face to face thing.

And he was just like, no, we did what we had to do, but we took no joy in it. We're not, we're not rah rah ing about it. Now that it was a huge piece of morale booster for the earth force. And in, in the beginning years later, when we get to see the prequel, we see him do that, in his past.

And it's the same thing. He's not celebrating the death of his opponents. He almost mourns them, and that is sort of the philosophical warrior aspect of him. he is, uh, a bit of that. I think Sinclair became, if Sinclair had stayed in the show, Sinclair was definitely the warrior monk type.

Sheridan is not quite the, that degree. That's why it very much works at Sinclair becomes, becomes Ranger One and Valen. Um, but Sheridan's still similar, and I don't think he would look at this as anything more than, Oh God, what have I done? You know, I don't want this to happen. He regrets it every time he has to do that.

He says it, um, to Bester after he's retaken Earth. He says, that's the difference between you and I. We both make really hard choices, um, but you see it as a

[00:42:07] **JOSH:** because you like it.

[00:42:09] **JOHN:** like it. Um, I carry it with me. He's not making himself to be a saint. He's like, I will live with these things. I have to carry the consequence of these things.

Bastard just enjoys it. He loves playing the game. And that's why I think he really, um, you're right. What, what, what a good moment. There are so many little moments. I think we got so lucky with the show, with, with, with the cast. Um, and other things. I think there's a lot of. I'll call it kismet in this show of just factors that work together that they didn't plan.

This is JMS's first show to ever run. He didn't have every piece lined up. Oh, this will work because this will work. I'm gonna give the perfect notes. I feel like a lot of people just knew, uh, and Bruce Batson especially got it. And said, I know who Sheridan is. Rewatching the season has been a delight because I see, Oh, this character knows exactly who he is.

There's no, wait, what is my motivation again? You know,

[00:43:01] **JOSH:** Completely.

[00:43:02] **JOHN:** Sheridan, Sheridan. Um, and a lot of the other characters get that too. And now we go on and we see, you know, what's the fallout from that? And you think, oh, well this will be a moment where this is just too far. The Centauri will pull back and this will force Earth into a conflict with the Centauri.

No! No, we don't even get that. A moment later, Lance is like, well, they're pissed, but they're being magnanimous. Uh, it just means, you know, they're working on that. Um, all they're going to do is they just demand you apologize. And sure it's just like his, his little speech in the mirror. There was, uh,

[00:43:38] **JOSH:** Really good performance. Like, I love His line reading at the very end where he repeats what, Mr. Wells Said to him where he just he says the exact same words, but with just a different inflection and I love Bruce Boxleitner's performance the way that he says that he's like as with everything else.

It's a thought that

[00:44:00] **JOHN:** yep.

[00:44:00] **JOSH:** it's just it's just like very subtle nuanced thing that he's doing in a show where I feel like Because the, uh, the intention and the emotions are, are very often, larger than life. You know, this was a moment, a scene in the show, which I really credit, JMS for, finding these little moments, these small moments in the show, because he understands intuitively that this is actually where the show lives.

Uh, so you have that small moment where it's just Sheridan alone, uh,

[00:44:37] **JOHN:** So,

[00:44:40] **JOSH:** that, seeing that. Is just as important, in terms of what the story is trying to communicate, of what it's trying to convey, as, seeing the, um, the way that it actually, plays out. the other moment, uh, that I loved is this scene that it's like a legendary scene.

but in the context of everything we have been talking about and everything that we're going through really struck me. It's, uh, near the beginning of the episode, where, Vir and Lennier have a little, moment in the Zocalo where,

[00:45:09] **JOHN:** Output,

[00:45:11] **JOSH:** all the stuff that's going on and, like, they're not telling me everything and, like, things are happening, I know it, but, blah, blah, blah.

And then they both die. say at the same time makes me nervous and they look at each other and they have this moment. these two characters from, places and cultures and backgrounds that probably are the most diametrically opposed. but in each other they find, kinship, um, community.

Uh, camaraderie, and both of them are really surprised at that moment because I don't think they really had any thought or intention about, what they were, doing or saying to each other, and it really spoke to me because, I mean, once again, it's another one of those small moments, you don't need to see that to, to understand the story, the plot

[00:45:55] **JOHN:** Okay.

[00:45:55] **JOSH:** of this episode, But it, it kind of took on a different valence for me watching it, now in February 2025.

Um, because it really reminded me of, Something that a lot of, people, you know, left of center have been saying in the past few months is that, the thing to do right now is, strengthen community, check in on your friends, reach out to

[00:46:19] **JOHN:** Silence.

[00:46:23] **JOSH:** that's how, you We're going to make it through this.

And that's what that scene made me think watching it today. And it was actually rather moving. It's like in the midst of all of this, like they sort of found each other and they shared this human moment. And that was the, nourishment that, allowed them to move on with their very stressful day.

[00:46:47] **JOHN:** Maybe this is what really, um, helped the show work the way that it did, you know, and why he realized the two ideas were the same, because he wasn't just going to tell this grand space opera story. It was going to be these very personal moments to The characters to the residents of Babylon five from all the different worlds.

Um, and that's something that I think is really rewarding to watch as a viewer and is very difficult to squeeze in there sometimes when you only have 44 minutes to put everything you want in there. This episode, amongst many others, feels very dense. You get so much out of every few minutes. Um, the plots, you know, invert themselves practically, you know, we think it's going one way, it goes another way, but there's also this other stuff happening.

Um, And then there's a human moment, or I should say, a character moment. It's, it's something that I really appreciated about the show, even if I wasn't aware of it while I was watching it, but it's why I cared about the characters so much. It's why we were so obsessed talking years ago about, you know, Jakar's story arc, because you, you start off the show and you think one thing, then you think another, then you think another, because everybody's growing and evolving.

You don't get that just in plot points. You have to do the character work, uh, for that. And we definitely got some of that. Um, but let's, uh, Let's dive into the deep of where, um, this episode really hits hard today. I mean, we've been talking a lot about the Narn and the story conflict. We've sort of set up what that means.

Uh, the Narn were, it's a little bit different than modern times. The Narn were, were, were getting aggressive. The Centauri were empowered by Londo and the Shadows and became an incredibly powerful force that completely subjugates. The Narn, uh, starts invading other worlds, reclaims their grand destiny in the stars.

They have their, their, their cultural moment, uh, looking back at their heritage and saying, we are dominant again. And, that really does, have a parallel to Russia and Ukraine. You know, two, two countries intertwined by history and conflict and different claims. And in the modern era, there was a country, there is a country, I separate from Russia.

Separate identity, separate culture. And like any country, there are different subgroups within. But we've, but we've seen that. And they were coexisting. And unlike Babylon 5, where the Narn provoked enough to give the Shadows an opening to get to Londo. there's no clear provocation except via ego. Which maybe is the parallel, because the Centauri We're feeling beaten down.

The Russians are the def you know, have been the defeated empire. They were they were the world's superpower, fighting with us over the title of who was number one, and then the Soviet Union collapses, and they've been in a state of, who are we? What are we? And their leadership has always been about reclaiming.

And since the beginning of this century, it's been about reclaiming their place in the world, their, their, their, their view of honor and dignity. And there was no reason for a conflict between the two countries on, on, on a, you know, purely tactical level. There's a lot of writing about that, Oh, if it wasn't for this, it wasn't for this.

At the end of the day, there was no reason for an invasion. It happened out of ego, out of nationalist identity and. A view of cultural domination, one against the other, and how it goes back and forth. So, the country's invaded, surprisingly is able to defend itself, and the U. S. acts as we assumed Earth would have acted in that moment, to at least back them up and say, hey, you can't invade them, you can't threaten your neighbors.

Um, Your, your claims are not valid. You can't do this. And we've sort of been in this stalemate back and forth for, for three years. And shockingly what this new administration has done and what Trump did was he comes in and not only says, well, I'll create peace and we'll get to the word peace in a moment.

He says, I'm going to do it without even bringing in Ukraine or the Europeans who are also threatened by Russian aggression. None of them will be part of it. None of them will be part of it. I couldn't have imagined somebody telling me a year ago or two years ago that, oh, the, the, the negotiations for the, for the, for peace in Ukraine are going to be not inclusive of the people of Ukraine who are invaded.

[00:51:16] **JOSH:** yeah, I mean, they're not really negotiations for the end of the war. It's like, how are we

[00:51:21] **JOHN:** how are the two big powers going to decide it ends, I guess.

[00:51:27] **JOSH:** Yeah, right.

[00:51:28] **JOHN:** And, but that is, I mean, the Earth Alliance was saying to the non aligned worlds. You are all on your own. You are on your own. We have a deal with a Centauri. They won't come after us. We won't come after them. We certainly won't restrain them from doing whatever they want to do.

And we're going to go do our own things. That is, that is what the negotiations are right now. Then pivots, and Trump says outright, When, you know, making not only false claims, uh, whether it was the popularity of, of Zelensky being at 4%, which is literally a repeated notion of Russian propaganda that is demonstrably false.

[00:52:06] **JOSH:** or that Ukraine started the

[00:52:08] **JOHN:** uh, Ukraine started the war and, and, and that is sort of this, you know, you know, this is back and forth of like, oh, well. like accusing, you know, abuse victim of it. Well, you brought it on yourself. That's what I really hear is, you know, and Trump might even be thinking that it's not that like literally started it by firing the first shot.

It's that, no, you brought this on your, your, yourself by daring to turn away from them. And that was an offense. so. there's, there's a lot. It's the kind of decision that realigns an entire planet or an entire galaxy. The non aligned worlds know they're on their own. NATO knows, Europe knows they're on their own now.

There's no, there's no concept now that the US is going to back them up. or Russia or anyone else threaten their countries. It's very clear that's the idea. You would never exclude the stakeholders of the Ukrainians and the Europeans from any negotiation and hold it in an entirely other part of the world.

It's not even, it's not even, neutral ground, I guess, but it's, it's insane. And then to go after the leader of that country, using the talking points of the other one. ISN then does that in this episode, you know, where they begin to, talk about the Centurion in very glowing terms and how great this agreement is and what kind of prosperity it will bring.

Well, it's obviously not going to bring prosperity. For the non aligned worlds, Minbari aren't under threat. That's why it's the non aligned worlds. But, um, it's really a shocking, quarterly end. It's only done for the sake of authoritarian power, cozying up to other authoritarian power. And that was, I mean.

Yeah, you, you, you have a viciously powerful, uh, Centauri regime trying to spread out and conquer its section of, of, of the galaxy. And we even know what it is based on, uh, when, uh, Londo tries to extricate himself from Morden. He says, this part you can have, the rest is ours for the shadows, you know. and Earth is doing the same.

Yes, we know they're being pulled and the strings are being pulled. by the shadows. But the shadows are very light touch as portrayed in this show. They're, they're not doing it for the gains of trying to take over, Earth or Centauri Prime. That, that's something that's really important, uh, in the storyline of this show.

It's not classic empire layering upon empire, layering upon empire. They are these ancients who have a philosophical grievance with their opponents and use everybody else as a cat's paw to accomplish their. their goal. So, no, they, they don't want to be in charge of Earth, they have no interest in that.

they want to manifest their idea of chaos and evolution by getting everybody to fight in the proper way. 

[00:54:56] **JOSH:** they just want the conflict, they have zero investment in your fight, or even who wins, they just want the conflict, they want the chaos, which is, you just kind of have to smirk because the Centauri don't get it. They don't understand that they don't yeah, I mean, not for a long time.

I think he eventually gets it. but they didn't choose you because, they saw you as worthy. they chose you because You were pathetic and, 

[00:55:25] **JOHN:** Vulnerable.

[00:55:25] **JOSH:** weak and vulnerable and vulnerable.

[00:55:28] **JOHN:** Yeah.

and notice that, that they tried, I mean, in Australia, they don't, you know, where the shadows tried to. weave in their, you know, sort of spider tentacles, if you will, you know, and, and they weren't successful everywhere. And that was in part because some of the forelands were there, or it was because the people weren't as conditioned for what their shadows were selling.

In this story, Earth was definitely heading in that direction. And it was that sort of, uh, Earth first mentality. And that's what this is. The, the notion of Earth first, U. S. first means that it's our interests. above all others, very transactional as we were discussing before, and it will sell out anybody for your own interests.

Even, even, and that's the thing that is hard to sometimes realize about this, is that even as these agreements seem like, oh, well, you have, you have US and Russia cozying up to each other, that can turn on a dime. That can turn on a dime anytime, and either one of those parties decides they want a different transaction and the other isn't fulfilling the terms they want.

So it's not like you've made a long term, ally and deep relationship. This is purely transactional, and the, the parallel historically, which we know is the, um, Molotov Ribbentrop Pact. 1939 is where, the Third Reich and Russia and Soviet Union will not attack each other and they can basically do their own things.

Now, obviously that doesn't go very well, because obviously Stalin must have thought, okay, well, you know, as long as we don't fight each other now, maybe fight each other in the future, but we can, we can gear up and build up that threat. And I, and, and my understanding of that history is that You know, Stalin was no idiot.

He still knew the threat that Hitler posed to, to the Soviet Union, but he viewed the non aggression pact as a way to buy himself time to further build up Russian military power, which did happen. Uh, it's just surprising how quickly that all fell apart and that Hitler stabbed him in the back and invaded.

So, yeah, When you make a deal with a predator, don't be surprised when they start hunting you. Like, that's, that's what's going to happen here. And that was something, uh, that's what I will say, because the show had other, elements in terms of the, the fallout of the, Vorlon and Shadow Wars, is that Earth and Centauri didn't themselves end up turning on each other directly.

This Earth was in its state longer, and was out of the picture. For the war, largely speaking, but it's the same idea would be, and this is what the, the, the, the crew about if I were to like, I said, Hey, if given the opportunity, they'll start poaching earth colonies too. Like don't, don't think, especially if they still have shadow forces backing them up, you know, the shadows aren't, they're going to look at who is going to come out on top and then set the next group up to fight.

Uh, it's just something of the naivete about the naivete. Of these types of agreements and Lance is portrayed as actually very naive because he he has that sort of body language like, Oh, how could you do this? How could you look like everything is surprising him? If you're so surprised by everything, maybe you shouldn't be negotiating a large agreement like this.

And even if his character wasn't, um, entirely, transactional, Wells very much is, and Earthdome very much is. I mean, I would imagine that if this, if, if the story went a slightly different direction, you know, Clarke was not trusting. Centauri Prime, or the Emperor. He was, he was very much about, doing what was for Earth first, and yeah, I mean, it'll be interesting to see what happens from here on out with us, and, and this is what leads me into where the episode gets, is that after, after this all occurs, Sheridan has to give his apology, the non aggression pact is signed.

he doesn't make it to give the apology because there's an attack on him by the Centauri who are angry at the loss of their ship, and they want to send a message that that's the other part of that kind of act. It wasn't just revenge, uh, they, you don't quickly set up that kind of revenge overnight.

That happened the next day because the Centauri had operatives and they needed to send a message to Earth. Yes, we're going to sign this pact with you. Don't fuck with us. So, they blow up Sheridan's, uh, uh, Tram, which was the first time I really saw that, and explained the gravity mechanics of B5, which is a whole other thing we can go into, which is really cool.

Um, and there he is, falling out of the tram, in the middle of the station, towards the ground, which is the rotating circle, interior, of Babylon 5. And that's when people see the explosion, and they see this guy falling! They know it's him. And the station's turning at, what, 55, 65 miles an hour. Uh, you can't survive that.

Even if you're gently coming down, you're not gonna be gentle when you hit the, when, when the rotating surface comes in contact. decides to take the risk and reveal himself, as it were. and saves his life by floating up in his In a form, to do so. And it's this amazing moment that quick side it's him as an angel to, to humans, to the, you know, beings of light or, or religious figures of every other alien species.

Except for Londo, who doesn't see a thing. And that's when you realize, or at least the show makes it out to be, Oh my god, the Vorlons are angels! And the good guys, Sheridan, meet in the next episode. Is that just what you want us to see? I mean, he's so great, he doesn't even, he doesn't even blink an eye asking

Kosh that 

question. 

[01:01:00] **JOSH:** not even in the next episode. It's in this episode.

[01:01:03] **JOHN:** Is it in the same episode? I'm already mixing them together. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. And the thing is, I never saw this episode air when it aired. This was one of our classic men, men, uh, conditioned, uh, discussions back when, the gross is on the store and I went in and it was the episode I missed because it's network TV.

If you didn't have your VCR set for it and you weren't home to watch it, you missed it 

[01:01:26] **JOSH:** they also, really screwed with, the scheduling because of the way, P 10, the Primetime Entertainment Network, had, syndication deals with, local. Networks, and like, they kept on changing when it was on. It happened all the time.

[01:01:40] **JOHN:** Oh, it drove me crazy. And for a year or two, I was, you know, discussing it with them. Oh, people at the store too. We were just going like, Oh, but you didn't see the best episode yet. And what it means, I'm like, no, what does it mean? Like, where did the show go? So I had to, I had to piece it together when the third season started.

uh, and from what I'd read, you know, about it, but this is also like, this is right as the internet is, this is actually the year the internet is born, as we know it, the World Wide Web. Oh God, dating isn't dating the world. Um, so. I didn't get that the first time and I had to wait until TNT took up the show and started showing reruns of it and I could record it and rewatch and wait for this episode to be aired and rewatch it.

, and then once I had it on DVD, I watched it a bunch of times and yeah, my initial thought was how cool is that? But also, oh, this is interesting. What are the Vorlons playing at? And then the thought comes to me now. So, there are no Vorlons. That's where the parallels of the show and our world sort of end, as far as we know, you know.

Um, in Babylon 5, you do have, in three or four episodes previous to this, you have, the Great Machine and Drahl reaching out to Sheridan and saying, I am the first Alliance, but there are many yet to come. And, so you have hope, even though Earth, by the end of this episode, is very clearly Slipped into authoritarian rule because after Kosh reveals himself, ISN doesn't talk about that, the shadow vessel is revealed.

The pilot is able to get the transmission out to ISN or they discover it. I think they, more so they discover it first. It's briefly aired before being yanked off the air. And Earth uses this, or Clark uses this as an opportunity to further stoke xenophobic alien fears that, oh my god, there's a threat. He knows exactly what it is, but he's using this public revelation to be like, ah, there are so many scary things out there, everyone.

You need me to rule and, you know, take control of everything. And it sets up his martial law order a few episodes later. so you do have, you literally have the, you have the reveal of the Vorlans, the reveal of the shadows. Our world isn't quite like that. We're just dealing with the. global politic. Um, if there are Vorlons active on our planet, I certainly don't know about it.

Um, or shadows. and if there are one, I would expect the other two. But the show goes in that direction of saying, oh, we're not going to just give you Kosh and his revelation. We're then going to counterbalance that with a shadow revelation. So you don't even get the good feeling from Kosh because now you know, ah, this isn't going to be good.

And I want to leave it with you now, that moment. Ivanova says about the non aggression pact at the end, and what, you had the exact line earlier about peace.

[01:04:23] **JOSH:** Yeah, so when I was re watching it, um, So Ivanova has this voiceover monologue that sort of closes off the episode and the season. She says a line that really, Struck a nerve with me. She says, something to the effect of Babylon 5 was our last, best hope for peace, but sometimes, peace is just another word for surrender, which really struck a chord with me because it's growing up and coming of age when we did, particularly, I'm, I'm thinking of the 1990s, you know, there was this, um, as you said, it was the end of history, the ideological conflict of our civilization, had been decided and we won, And maybe I am reading into this, but, there was a sense that, war and violence are a thing of the past, like now, you know, liberal capitalist democracies have won and, now we are waging combat, in the marketplace and the marketplace of ideas and, we have to be fair and even handed.

The worst thing you can do is start a fight, either physical Or, you know, do anything that shakes up the, um,

brand of centrism, this, you know, like the civility police, right? I mean. Especially in the last few years, it's, it's just been rendered in stark relief, where in moments of great crisis and struggle, there are all these very loud voices that are calling for civility, before addressing any other issue, right?

Uh, before acknowledging the hurt or, the damage or the grievance that is legitimate, because, what they value is, civility, is the absence of conflict, right, the maintenance of the status quo,

[01:06:18] **JOHN:** And that's how they view peace. Peace is the absence of those

things. 

[01:06:21] **JOSH:** the, the absence of conflict, but like, Uh, you were just saying, seeing, the U. S. and Russia discussing the fate of Ukraine, and I think you mentioned, before we started recording, uh, you said you came across a tweet from a right winger that said something,

[01:06:36] **JOHN:** Yeah, it's, it's said, So this tweet, from a self identified, uh, You know, sort of MAGA guy said, uh, just four simple lines. It said. the U. S. wants peace, Russia wants peace, Ukraine does not want peace, Europe does not want peace.

And initially, of course, my first reaction was, oh God, this is fucking idiot. But then I realized, he's, there's a way to interpret that in this lens that is very disturbing because from, a certain point of view, that tweet is correct. That the US and the Russia and Russia are willing and seeking a peace that involves the loss of territory and the loss of who knows what for Ukraine, and a decrease in security for Europe, Europe and Ukraine do not want peace under those terms.

specific circumstances. In other words, this is, this is extortion. This is saying, we will give you peace. We will give you the lack, we will give you an absence of violence if you give us what we want. That to me is no different than somebody threatening you with a gun and mugging you. I will not shoot you.

If you give me your wallet, how is that any different conceptually than that? I don't want violence. I have a gun in your face, but I'm not, I haven't shot, I don't want violence. You give me your wallet and no one has violence. That's Russia and Ukraine right now. There's no, you know, Question there. So, yes, what does that word peace mean?

Uh, as, as, as said later in the show, peace is a concept. Which part of the concept are you, are you talking about? Now, peace does not necessarily mean it's just. Peace doesn't mean that it is, fair or not, does not involve oppression. In this very show, the Narn and the Centauri are at peace. in the broader sense, the Norn have been pummeled back into the Stone Age, the, the deaths are uncountable, uh, the oppression is massive, but they have peace.

Uh, and this, and this brings me back to Sheridan, brings me back to the crux of the show. We were talking about his character, the way he didn't want to have to fire on and regretted the deaths of the Centauri. Well, it's a line that they repeat throughout the show that we get, I think, in the third season from his father, and he goes on and he says, you know, my father always taught me, never start a fight, but always finish it. And that is the, crux of Sheridan. He's not looking to start a fight. He doesn't go around starting fights, but he will finish one when it is started. And the thing is, the fight was already started, just the way that in our world. The fight was already started. The question is, how do we finish it?

It's happening right now. It's not over. You want peace. kind of peace do you want? What does that peace look like? And when I read JMS's autobiography, and I need to refresh myself on that because it's been a few years now, um, but, uh, there was a great parallel and he taught, and he was talking about that and the way he experienced things in life.

He's a fairly imposing Man, you know, he has some strength to him, and he has some size to him, and I think he saw that in himself, and he took that on. I believe he talks about stories where he did have to face off against bullies or people violently threatening those around him, and it was never an interest to go off and start something.

But if it happened around him, by God, it was going to get finished. And I think that is the center of Sheridan. That's the center of the show, which is to say, yeah, it's not about just civility and decorum. That's the word I was looking for, decorum, as you were sort of talking about. Oh, don't, don't raise your voice.

That's Neville Chamberlain. That's, we all have peace in our era. It doesn't matter if it's All these people are falling under, under a dictator. We will have peace. How wonderful will that be? And everybody says, yeah, yeah, the decorum police drive me crazy because the world could be burning around you.

People are like, well, don't raise your voice too much. Don't, don't break the rules of how you speak. It's like, but it's burning around me. What do I do?

[01:10:40] **JOSH:** yeah, I mean, this is a really huge, um, topic, but I think it's something that we're going to return to a lot as we continue to watch the show and have these discussions, because you're right, never start a fight, but always finish it. is a central theme of this whole show. Sometimes, peace is just another word for surrender.

Um, then you know in year three, the opening credits and the opening monologue changes every season. the first two seasons, Babylon 5 is our last season. Best hope for peace, and then, and I'm getting, goosebumps on my arm just thinking of it, um, in season three, it changes to, Babylon 5 was our last best hope for peace.

It failed.

[01:11:22] **JOHN:** Nailed. 

[01:11:23] **JOSH:** And then she says, but in the year of the shadow war, it became something greater. Our last best hope for victory. Right? So, having, peace is not, peaceful all the time. Um, I was just, listening to, Kim Stanley Robinson, the science fiction author.

On a podcast, and he's famous for what, someone called his utopian fiction, And he said something to the effect of in this interview, and I'm paraphrasing, if you have a peaceful, egalitarian society, there will be those who want to tear it down,

and that society has to defend itself to preserve its society. But far are you willing to go in terms of conflict, in terms of violence,

[01:12:12] **JOHN:** Okay. 

[01:12:13] **JOSH:** that peaceful, egalitarian society? because if you, value You know, civility or the absence of conflict above all else, then those forces will go largely unopposed and you will lose that society. And I think what JMS is saying here is that, and as you, so astutely recall from his memoir, which I also have to revisit because I completely forgotten this, um, the idea that. he had the physical capacity for force and violence, but he, chose not to use it unless he had to. you know, I think that is,

that is the attitude that you have to have when you are facing forces that are intent on your own destruction. It's the intolerance paradox again, right?

[01:13:01] **JOHN:** goes right back to that. And it really, you know, a point worth bringing up is the title of the autobiography, Becoming Superman. And and for for listeners and for anybody else who hasn't read it. it's not what you think. It's not, you know, we think Superman superpowers, right? this was a key figure for for J.

M. S. And it's about the sort of ideal and responsibility. Behind that not becoming super powerful. You may never become super powerful really really cool stuff Really stuff that I think we're going to get to explore in this. Um, I certainly hope that this doesn't lead us towards Uh what actually happens in severed dreams?

um, but you know, we do live in interesting times so we will uh, we will see but I I wonder where the, as we go on from here, I wonder where Babylon 5 is, what Babylon 5 is. Maybe, I mean, maybe I shouldn't say it out loud, I mean, I wonder if it's, uh, Canada. you have, you have the poor Canadians up there being like, wait, they want to take us as the 51st state?

Um, and, uh, you know, whether that is obloviating or not remains to be seen. But, uh, this show was predicated on. Some group being able to stand up somewhat independently for a while outside of, uh, the purview of power. And, uh, we'll see. We'll see what happens. But until then, I mean, until then, it looks like, uh, it looks like the Narn are on their own.

It looks like we very well may see. The Ukrainians on their own for, for a while yet. Um, I'm curious, I'm curious what the next couple of weeks bring to us and we may end up revisiting this topic in real time based on what, what happened because if we've learned anything, oof, every week there's a lot of news,

[01:14:41] **JOSH:** certainly true. yeah, I'm glad that we're doing this because it's, uh, it's actually very, I think, good in that it's a way to not shy away from what's going on, to be able to talk about it, but in a way that is, um,

[01:14:58] **JOHN:** a little more cathartic, you

[01:15:00] **JOSH:** yeah,

[01:15:00] **JOHN:** know, it's acknowledging what we're seeing or what we're, what we're observing and trying to communicate without it just being another discussion about. Politics and the news. That's, that's the brilliance of storytelling is that you get to use different parts of your brain and you get to handle it through different lenses.

Um, it's, it's honestly, it can be too much. It really is too much to just focus on it, reading. The news, it's overwhelming and that's maybe the point of it. But, um, we're not built for it, but we are built for stories and we're built for myths where we're built for allegory and, and, and similarities. And to go, aha, wait, if that's like this and this is like that, then maybe I can have, I have a different thought about this now and maybe, you know, for whoever ends up listening, they'll realize, huh, it's not about these two. Random people just talking to each other about everything they can imagine, being right about everything, but that it inspires a different way of thinking, a different angle on something. And that's what the show gave me. It was, it was, oh, there's a different way of thinking about, if anything, just TV drama, but maybe Uh, Conflicts, uh, on the larger scale can be thought of differently and I, my takeaway from you today is that word peace doesn't mean what we necessarily think it means.

And there's a lot to look at when people use that word. Um, so here's to more of that.

[01:16:25] **JOSH:** indeed.

[01:16:25] **JOHN:** All right. So with the end of that, we don't know what episode is going to be next. Uh, following chronological order, we will probably end up going back to visit a few episodes, but I think based on what happens in real time, the next episode is up in the air. 

[01:16:39] **JOSH:** I'm thinking of Voices of Authority from Season 3,

[01:16:43] **JOHN:** Oh, interesting.

[01:16:44] **JOSH:** maybe a different one, because I mean, there's a ton of stuff in Season 2. It's just tricky because I don't know, like, the parallels, I don't know where we are in the Babylon 5 timeline, like, I don't know where in the story we are, it's, it seems like we're, 

[01:16:58] **JOHN:** And we're going a little

faster. 

Counter is what we think. In some ways, we're going faster, and in other ways, it's going to slow down.

[01:17:06] **JOSH:** what I'm taking away from this is that we should have started this podcast in 2016, John.

[01:17:11] **JOHN:** yeah, yeah. yeah. Who would have thought, you know? Oh, that's wild. That's wild.

I look forward to the next time.

[01:17:19] **JOSH:** same.

[01:17:20] **JOHN:** so here's us signing off from Last Best Hope, for what remains to be seen.
