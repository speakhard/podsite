## Transcript

[00:00:04] **JOHN:** Hello everyone. Welcome to Last Best Hope, a Babylon 5 podcast where we talk about one of our favorite shows of all time and its unfortunate and surprising relevance to today's geopolitical circumstances.

I can't think of a better show as we've explored it that actually really explores, the major issues of authoritarianism and anything related to that slide. So here we are at an episode in Season 3, Messages from Earth. And I didn't expect to get to Season 3 so quickly, but Season 3 is, that's where the tracks are parallel to our current, our current world, it seems right now.

Uh, so this episode is a really interesting one the crew and the captain in particular are forced to make a real decision. This is the one where you realize there may the viewers, and as, as I'm going back to it, really began to realize there may be no turning back. This episode begins with a really dramatic, literally a dramatic moment, a package has arrived at Babylon 5 that in a previous episode we hinted at, was one of those layered setups that Marcus was referencing in Exogenesis. And the package is a person, uh, in the form of Dr. Mary Kirkish with a ominous message to the command staff of Babylon 5.

And her intro is done in a way, it, it's. drum like music, like a march, almost like they're being marched to the gallows, if you will. And she's walking through the station, being escorted with security, very tight security to avoid Nightwatch to avoid anybody else. And there she delivers a message. And that message is one that terrifies the entire command staff. and that's, that earth government has uncovered a shadow vessel buried on Ganymede, one of Jupiter's moons, and is trying to reactivate it. So you think, okay, that's, that's the big sci-fi beginning of this episode. where that goes is in a number of different directions.

Uh, but I just, you know, every time I watch this episode, it's that dramatic drum music, which is not something that Christopher Franke used a lot of, um, where she's coming into the station and more than what I said earlier, it's more of a military drum. Like they're, they're getting attention.

[00:02:05] **JOSH:** It's very effective. Like when she finally starts speaking, you're really primed for something really weighty and dramatic.

Some, some bombs to be dropped

[00:02:16] **JOHN:** Yeah. 

[00:02:16] **JOSH:** and to the show credit, know, it is worth it. Uh, what she says is, pretty chilling.

[00:02:21] **JOHN:** It was as if, they'd said, okay, it's on, it's happening. we have been, building to this. We've been talking about it. the characters have been worried about it. but here's where we get a big moment, 

and you're like, oh God, this is real. This, this is big. And unlike, let's say, a resident in the more cloistered Earth Alliance now, the, the command crew, Babylon 5, know what's at stake. They've now had encounters with shadows. They're battling the shadows. They, they're fully aware of the, of the war that is about to break out completely into the open.

Like that's a big part of it. This, this episode is, you know, the revelation and how the ships are controlled. There's a lot that gets put into this, but the characters know that, and they're in this very difficult position that you need that tension for because they're in the position that no one else can act.

No one, there's not like, oh, well there are other people who know this is a problem. The other people who have this, they're the only ones who have the intelligence, the only ones who have the knowledge. Lots of that is coming from Delenn, uh, and the alliance, uh, with the Vorlons. So there's nobody on Earth who actually, for, for all the, you know, yeah, the shadows are influencing, but there's, there's, there's nobody in the Earthdome apparatus that might have a worry the way that our main characters would, because they just don't know, and they're being kept in the dark.

[00:03:37] **JOSH:** The other thing that. and correct me if I'm wrong, but what we discover in this episode is not just that Earthdome has been compromised by the shadows, but that they are working with them. I mean, they are in league with them. And I think that this is the first moment where two stories really collide and become part of the same larger story.

[00:03:59] **JOHN:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:04:01] **JOSH:** which is a hell of a revelation. Previously, you know, in season two when we were learning more and more about the shadows, it sort of seemed like a parallel story that was happening in addition to what was happening on Earth, but not necessarily as intertwined.

Then we find out that, oh, the Earth Alliance using the threat of the shadows to further their own ends. But then in the beginning of this season, we just discovered that the shadows were directly involved with helping Clark assassinate Santiago, and now we see they are really intimately involved working with the shadows here. They're sort of trying to do something in secret from the shadows, right? 

[00:04:41] **JOHN:** I definitely picked up that part. Was that, was that this is, this is where it added layers onto it, which really made it work even better, which is that the shadows are influencing and have operatives and are working. But Clark is a step further than that, Clark wants it to be about him. So he and his agents, they wanna take this, this, this shadow ship that has been discovered on Ganymede.

And the quick background on that is that this is a ship that likely was stranded there, and de powered during the war a thousand years ago. I think Clark really believes that if he can get hold of some of the technology himself, he's gonna have to be beholden to the shadows. He's really out for himself. He's really out for, and this is where I'll bring the comparison a little bit to today.

Uh, it's a little bit of a stretch, a little bit not, is that he doesn't want any other handlers. He doesn't want, you know, he'll use them the way they're using him, but in his vision, he wants earth first, earth dominant with him at the helm. And all those conditions have to be true. Uh, it's, it's, it's very similar to the impression we get about the current president.

America First with him at the top. And it's all a zero sum game. So the exclusion, others must be second. Um, and even the people who are allies in getting there, other countries, other forces, other businesses will be put into subservience a as part of that. And I think almost every ally who's ever worked with the current administration has found that to be a, a common story is that you will get your benefit for a while.

You'll get your largesse and then either and, and primarily when you no longer are useful, it'll be kicked to the curb. And certainly if you, if you speak out. Clark is looking to do the same thing here. He, he doesn't wanna be under the thumb of the shadows. And the shadows don't seem to be taking too much of an insult to that because the shadows are playing a different game entirely.

They're not like that. That's what goes to the space opera that's above what's happened in our planet right now is that they, they just want the conflict. They just want the different things and they'll always be able to build somebody else up to take out the other anthill. You know, that's, that's why they, using that example later on is so great, is that they're not really interested in President Clark or which form of government or which, that they just wanna see which anthill they can build up and how they can get them to fight.

So I was surpri, that's why initially I was surprised. Well, why didn't the shadows, you know, when they found out that this ship, which is living, so it's a living shadow due to an extent, why didn't they get really pissed at what Earthdome was doing? They didn't care. I. They're above all that. President Clark doesn't understand that part.

They're, it's above him. But he thought he could get out of this by saying, this ship will be ours. We will reverse the technology. We will have shadow technology and then we will, you know, non aggression pack be damned. They will take over the galaxy best they can.

[00:07:34] **JOSH:** And it's funny too because you say Clark isn't aware of how the shadows are operating on another level, and they're not like really, like the Earth Alliance isn't the real player that the shadows have probably led them to believe that they are. It's the exact same with the Centa uri, you know, you hear the Centauri talking about how, you know, they're so powerful and their rightful place and this and that, blah, blah, blah, but the shadows, they're letting you think that. Um, but the idea that it wouldn't even occur to Clark that maybe the shadows are way more powerful and playing a whole other game, the idea that he thinks he can get one over on the shadows just speaks to his narcissism and his lack of imagination. You know, the idea that like, well, if I'm having this idea, it's a brilliant plan and it'll totally work because how can they, how can they outsmart me?

Right?

[00:08:24] **JOHN:** Right on that this week and last week you have the tariffs and there I'm reading the Wall Street Journal. That, that, that is a Murdoch owned paper. So.

[00:08:33] **JOSH:** No liberal rag, the Wall

[00:08:35] **JOHN:** There's no liberal rag there. The, the, this is a Murdoch paper, part of the News Corp Empire, and they're very clearly talking about what China has done since the last round of tariffs came into effect in the first Trump administration.

And they've built up an arsenal of tools to use in this exact case where it will, where, where, you know, everything from being able to target individual companies, weaken our intellectual property, all kinds of tools. York is really fascinating economic detail into that. But they were planning for this because they said, well, if this happens, we want be in a position to leverage more pain on the US than the US can leverage on us.

And it seems to be that's what's going to play out. So you have the president here in our world saying, oh, we're going to, to throw up these dry tariffs. We're gonna force every bit of table and we're gonna get these amazing deals that are gonna all be in our favor. Not understanding that China is playing a different game.

They have a different government structure, one that is itself authoritarian and centralized and has a lot more power and plans in the long term with a lot less ego and a lot more ruthlessness towards a. Realism and he's not ready for that. He's not ready for the fact that we, as in this country, will end up suffering more on that end and over there.

Well, if, if, if his people have to suffer in China, he's fine with that in the short run, knowing that the long run game will be an even bigger 

[00:10:06] **JOSH:** Conveniently, he also doesn't care about people who are gonna suffer in the short term.

[00:10:10] **JOHN:** Exactly.

[00:10:11] **JOSH:** Um, yeah, it's also wild. I'm gonna call it again, it's, I think narcissism,

uh, combined with hubris where it doesn't even cross their mind that the US is not the dominant player that has all the cards. Like it doesn't even cross his mind that we may not, be in as strong a position as he, he thinks.

[00:10:35] **JOHN:** Which is fascinating. He said, he said on camera to Zelensky in, in that Oval Office meeting. You don't have the cards. You don't have the cards. But he's totally blind to the fact that this other power on our planet has a lot of cards and arguably has been planning, and may have, as a result, may have even more cards and, and certainly has a higher threshold of pain.

That may be the best card that they have to play is that as a nation, they have a higher threshold for that, , between un authoritarian regime on their side, but also population and a nationalization that is willing to go through that, especially if it means, winning in the end. And, and that's something that you can't quite be said.

Uh, you know, I I I think that to some point there will be a massive backlash if, if the economy crashes. And I'm almost getting the point where I say when, um, where people will demand accountability, but that also weakens that, that arguably it weakens his delusion of, oh, well, you know, that's not gonna be a problem.

We can negotiate hard and push them to the wall. So delusion is a big part of any authoritarian. and, and not to say China doesn't have its own delusions and they've gotten themselves into trouble with it, it's just they, they've sort of mastered some of the discipline around that. So I, you know, that's, that's where, yeah, there is sort of a loose parallel to this.

Traditional figure of authoritarianism and President Clark is that he's delusional in, in his beliefs about the Earth Alliance and delusional about his own position, which I think is why at bookends with his, with him taking his own life at the end, because it wasn't, it wasn't somebody else doing it, it wasn't one of his cabinet members.

It wasn't a, no one else was able to get to him. this was, well, Sheridan's riding in the alien fleet is coming in. Like, I, I'm not, like I've lost. So he ends it himself and then scorched earth most to incinerate earth.

[00:12:30] **JOSH:** because he's also, similar to Trump, he, his sense of self has merged with the sense of state, right? So if something happens, with the Earth Alliance or with the US in our world, um, whatever happens against your country is like a personal affront that affects your self-worth, your sense of self.

It's almost they take it, personally. Because they see the state, you know, as an extension of themselves. Um, when you said some degree of delusion seems to be a feature of these authoritarian rulers, I thought to myself that makes sense in that it's very hard for me to get in the mindset of a person who wants that kind of control and dominance over everything. Like, that sounds terrible. It makes sense to me that the kind of personality that complete total power over everybody is a desirable thing and that they should be the one to have that power, you gotta have some amount of delusion, it seems to me. 

[00:13:39] **JOHN:** Yeah, delusion and definitely, it's definitely a different mental framework than what I think most people function with. Some would say that obviously that correlates to a high level of sociopathy, maybe even, uh, psychopathy. Um, but when looking at stories through, through history, whether they're shows and books or actual historical examples, I think that there's generally been a trend, and you certainly notice it in writing, which is that, oh, the best leaders in reality and in fiction are those who want it least, but have it thrust upon them.

That's general storyline. And you see that here in this show. That's Sheridan. He's a natural leader when it comes to his military record and everything else. But he is always reluctant to be the absolute, he doesn't want to be the absolute, he's portrayed by ISN as that, but he doesn't want it. He, he doesn't live every day like, oh, how can I get more control?

It's how can I, how can I do the right thing and then step back and keep things going in my, in whatever my job is like. He didn't come on to Babylon 5 like, well now it's my way or the highway, and I get to remake the world through this place. It was like, oh, there's more going on here than I thought.

Oh crap, I have to take this episode. Is him making that decision to take the next step reluctantly when he goes on earth. It is not a about him. Oh, I'm just ready to go ride in and make it all about me and take over the world. It's, it's, it's the, it's, it's the reluctance. And I, I think back the two examples, and this is, this is, this is from an author who I now have a very tortured relationship with.

Orson Scott Card, who wrote Enders Game, you know, turned out not to be the person I'd hoped when I first read the book. And I think a lot of us read Enders game, uh, as, as teenagers or in our young life. And it was a phenomenal book. Uh, not knowing that the author was, uh, problematic, to say the least.

But, um, and I feel bad for him for other reasons. I I could do a whole episode on him, but the book featured a notion about leadership and the reluctance and. I always remember reading that where he cites two historical examples of leaders who gave up power, and that's why they're the greatest leaders.

The first one was cincinnatus in Ancient Rome and during the Republic, and he used, uh, during a time of crisis, the, the Romans had a law that allowed for a dictator. That's where the word comes from to assume power for six months. And that will be to get the matters of state, the matters of whatever it was, security, crisis, famine, under control, uh, and then power would properly return to the Senate.

So Cinncinnati is given this power during a crisis. Um, and at the end of six months, he's asked by the senate or, or members of the Senate to remain in power. He's done such a good job. Rome is, is, is doing well. Now, again, they've, they've weathered the crisis and he stands and says, no, I'm going back to my farm.

I'm gonna go back to my family. The last thing you want is for me to continue, even if I'm doing a great job. The point is I'd now be the permanent dictator. You'd go against your own laws and eventually I wouldn't be a good leader. And where would we be then? And of course, years later, Julius Caesar, the same laws enact, is utilized and he crosses that threshold and goes beyond the six months, and famously is assassinated by the Senate.

but his heir, Augustus Caesar, takes the name, becomes the first emperor, and you see the, the functional end of the republic as a result. The other example is George Washington. Um, and that's a little bit vaguer in some senses, but he, he was asked in the beginning to be a monarch, declined that as, as they were figuring out what to make this constitution, uh, look like.

And after eight years, two terms, uh, you know, asked to stay on and said, no, otherwise this will become a form of monarchy or, or, or, or continued power struggle. Um, interestingly that he doesn't live much longer past his second term. It's almost like, you know, the, the in fictitious characters, they, they sort of like ride off into the sunset.

Sheridan gets that, you know, is that when his time is up, it's up and he literally sort of goes off. But the fact that those were the two examples and there weren't many others, always, always got me from that book. I said, wait, but, but where's the list of other, of other leaders in history? The, the process of becoming a leader, the process of becoming a ruler of any sort tends to filter out the people who are good for the position, and it tends to elevate the people who are worst for it.

And that's just ever a human thing. And fiction loves to explore the idea of the person thrust into power who doesn't want it, and is moral and can do the right thing.

[00:18:19] **JOSH:** Um. There are two points that I wanna make along these lines. Um, one, I think may steer us down a rabbit hole. So, the first one is, you know, we're talking about, the kind of personality that would see that kind of total dictatorial power as desirable. and also, you know, uh, I think in previous episodes we were discussing this idea that just some, some people naturally have more fascistic sort of personalities and, fascistic impulses.

I was really struck since those conversations, watching this episode. There's a scene near the beginning of the episode where, um, the head of the Nightwatch walks into the security office, to tell Zach that there was a new Nightwatch meeting the next day or something. by the way, he's, uh, played by an actor named Vaughn Armstrong, who does a lot of guest spots on Star Trek.

probably the only one without makeup was, um, Admiral 

[00:19:16] **JOHN:** Oh, he's the admin. 

[00:19:18] **JOSH:** Enterprise. 

[00:19:19] **JOHN:** yeah.

Yeah. And he's quite a sympathetic good character in that show.

[00:19:24] **JOSH:** No. Yeah. And he's actually really good as this, um, you know, Nightwatch security flunky or whatever you wanna call him. Strangely when I was looking him up, he's only ever credited as Security Guard \#1. Which I thought was interesting. because he's very central in at least three or four episodes.

JMS never gave him a name, 

[00:19:47] **JOHN:** that had to be deliberate.

[00:19:49] **JOSH:** right. Yeah, yeah. so he has that scene with Zach and they have a little bit of a back and forth. And then as he's leaving, he stops and he looks at the wall of security camera monitors and he says, you know, seeing them like this sometimes kind of makes you feel a little like God doesn't it?

And he kind of smiles and he leaves. it's very clear that he enjoys having that sort of power and control I don't know. I thought that was a very revealing line, because I could also imagine. Somebody sitting there and feeling a lot of like weight and responsibility, um, and or maybe feeling like they're seeing something that they shouldn't see.

[00:20:34] **JOHN:** You can definitely contrast that to Garibaldi when he's sitting in front of those screens. He is, he's watching and he's nervous, he's protecting, he's concerned. Um, it is the power that's granted to the security force of the station and security generally in our world, but he doesn't, he doesn't seem to, uh, revel in it in any way throughout any part of the series.

Um, and that, and that's the difference. That's, that's the difference between the, the way you portray those kinds of things and why the characters end up where they are in, in this kind of, 

uh, reason, The reason why it struck me was because it had nothing to do with the literal nuts and bolts of what they were talking about in the scene. So the fact that that's where he chose to close the scene, right? Having him say that line, I think it's supposed to make you reflect on the kind of a personality, the kind of a person who's engaged in this.

[00:21:30] **JOSH:** so there's that. And ye what you were saying about Sheridan and leaders who, you know, the best leaders are the ones Who've relinquished their power. There's something that I noticed in this episode and it's followed up on again in Severed Dreams, and I'm not quite sure what to make of it.

I do think there's something there. So I'm wondering, I it strikes you, but you know, there's a long scene in this episode where Sheridan is talking about something that his father had done for him, right?

he's reminiscing about this moment that his dad was a very loving and giving father

[00:22:07] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[00:22:08] **JOSH:** in a moment where he needed it. And then, jumping ahead a little bit, in severed dreams, when he makes the decision to break away from earth, the last thing he does right before he makes the announcement that they are seceding from the Earth Alliance. He calls his dad.

[00:22:23] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[00:22:24] **JOSH:** it makes me wonder what JMS is saying, I'm not even necessarily saying that it's something conscious on his part, but what is

the implication here? like what is the role I don't know, maybe it's having the example of a strong leader who was, 

[00:22:42] **JOHN:** Yeah, 

[00:22:42] **JOSH:** and compassionate

[00:22:43] **JOHN:** they referred, they refer to his father. And this is, and, and for listeners, just to jump, you know, jumping ahead in the episode is that when Sheridan makes the call to destroy this shadow ship, you know, they take the white star and, 

he's trying to sleep, and we'd already had some info on his father. He's a diplomat that had some talk about, you know, things getting difficult on, on Earth, but. This story was a really beautiful one. This, this is where the episode goes again, goes from like, you know, it's the intense, it's the, we gotta take care of the situation thing to the beautiful tender moments, that really get underrated in the show.

And they make this show. The, the, the tender moments, the beautiful, the character moments make everything in this show. And I love that of people I'm getting to watch the show now. They're actually seeing that and, and, and, and telling me about that. I'm like, yes. Okay. So, so you're, you're seeing that like you're, you're getting to experience that.

So when he says that his father, he was, what was the exact story? He was, he was stressed out. He was taking a test for the academy, uh, or something like that,

[00:23:45] **JOSH:** been studying and he was up all night and he couldn't sleep and he knew that he just needed to get a couple hours, but it was like, you know, in the morning and he was wide

[00:23:52] **JOHN:** yeah,

[00:23:53] **JOSH:** and his dad knew that the thing that would help him sleep, he always loved the sound of rain hitting the roof.

[00:24:00] **JOHN:** yeah, yeah.

[00:24:01] **JOSH:** And then it's very sweet because, he's relaying the story, to Delenn. So there's actually like another layer, another relationship that is sort of developing here in this scene. But, Delenn says, and did it start to rain? And Sheridan was like, no, my dad went outside with the garden hose and stood there making it rain

[00:24:23] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[00:24:23] **JOSH:** I fell asleep.

[00:24:24] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[00:24:25] **JOSH:** know, which you just imagine. I mean, that's the kind of dad we all want, right? I.

[00:24:30] **JOHN:** It really is that that was one of those moments. And again, like I can, I really can't remember 25, 30 years ago watching most of the show. That's a moment I do remember because the language that's used, it literally created the visual in my mind. I had it back then when I first watched the show. I literally saw my version of the house he lived in the roof and the garden hose and the father, like that was an image I had in my head from all the way back when this first aired because it's because it was, it just, it just gets to you.

And then of course, Delenn issues a, a, a statement in Minbari that like is like telling the Siri of, of the white star to start playing rain a, a beautiful, you know, wrap up for that moment. But you wonder who is this father? And, and, and of course I'm watching the show, you're like, oh, that makes sense.

This is the man who raised John Sheridan. And his father's a diplomat. He's a very well respected, individual who has wielded power as a result. Like it, it was referred to that he's, he's obviously wielded power in a very responsible manner. I, I'll even go so far as to say that the way he's portrayed, both in severed dreams, the father, um, and I wanna bring up the actor's name in a minute 'cause I thought he did a great job.

[00:25:42] **JOSH:** Rantz Howard. He's, Ron Howard's, uh, dad.

[00:25:45] **JOHN:** Yes, yes, yes. Um, and when, when he basically tells, he's like, well, son, you gotta do what you gotta do. And, and then the lessons that Sheridan speaks later of, you know, never start a fight, but always finish it. What I'm really getting at with that is that he, Sheridan's father is portrayed as the best manifestation of masculinity.

Something that's really lacking, uh, these days. When, when, when we talk about the crisis of, of young men. That is masculinity to me. That is the ideal of masculine energy. Ma it, it, it is, it's not overbearing but it is strong. It is quiet, powerful and compassionate. All those things at the same time.

And Sheridan reaches out to him 'cause he knows that his father understands, he knows that the, he will find that last bit of strength he needs in that moment. Like it's really beautiful. And this moment sets that up with the rain because, you know, wow. He would go out there and just a simple act like that.

And we all say, yeah, but that's it. That's what it's all about. And that same man is going out often being a diplomat. He's off off. Do what needs to do and, and when they meet, when all this is resolved, that's another beautiful moment. So I think that, you know, not gonna dive too deep into, uh, JMS himself.

I just know from his autobiography, he, he definitely has some life experience and, and, uh, uh, uh, views on this, which I think he really wrote well, 

[00:27:07] **JOSH:** uh, you said, you're not going to delve too deeply into JMS. that is exactly what I was gonna do next. Um, only, just to the extent that, you know, having read his autobiography Becoming Superman, which we've referred to in previous episodes, without getting into it, his father was probably pretty close to the antithesis of this example.

[00:27:31] **JOHN:** Mm-hmm. Yeah.

[00:27:32] **JOSH:** after reading that, it sort of struck me how when JMS is writing father characters, and it's not just Sheridan's father, I think, this one is the most fully realized father relationship, simply because, you know, we're with Sheridan for a long time. Uh, but Sinclair also, mentions his father, way back in season one.

And the way that he talks about him, you can tell he also held him in very high regard. And then also, I remember in, Jeremiah, that was on Showtime, the very beginning of that. The very first episode was the main character writing a letter to his dad, who I think is dead. Yes. because it ends with, I miss you every day.

So JMS, when I read about his father in his autobiography, he's writing these idealized versions of what he imagines a father, a good father to be.

[00:28:32] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[00:28:34] **JOSH:** which I think is just striking in that it does seem like he has this fixation with these, this notion of like the good father, the idealized father. you know, you don't have to have a degree in psychology to figure out that that fixation probably has something, to do with the lack of having it in his own life.

I would venture to say. Um, and I just find it interesting, you know, that as you say, and I would agree, this ideal version of masculinity that we see on display from Sheridan Vis-a-vis his father, only came from someone who had it lacking in his own life. And from whatever examples he had or from whatever he imagined that would look like, he, he created a fiction, 

[00:29:22] **JOHN:** he created a fiction that was very real though. It, it wasn't a fantasy, it wasn't a, it wasn't a Superman, it, it, it was an ideal, but it was something that we all connect to without being, without saying, oh, that's impossible. We've all met, whether it's our own families, uh, members of our families or, or, or friends of the family or people we've just encounter in the world.

We've all met that ideal at some point. And, and he met that ideal at different points in his life. It just wasn't his own father. So he's writing that. It, it really does connect and that, that gets to something about JM S'S writing and, and what you do give from his autobiography about him as a person is very often there's a notion that that trauma begets trauma.

That the abused becomes the abuser, uh, when the wheel turns. And that it is the less common scenario where the person is able to take the pain and horror of their experience and turn it around entirely, uh, in, in the life that they lead. , and he has a lot of, a lot of statements about that in his autobiography and, and which also informed his choices of what to do and what not to do in his own life.

but it was an example of somebody who was incredibly self-aware, um, and incredibly striving. And that's why for, for, for listeners who are, you know, this autobiography is called Becoming Superman. Not because JMS imagines that he became Superman, the superhero with flying, x-ray vision, et cetera.

Superman is held up as an ideal of moral behavior. An archetype to aspire to. Becoming Superman is becoming that, not becoming Superpowered. It's a really interesting distinction, despite having the, the, the standard Superman, you know, iconography on the book cover. That's what it's about. And, and that, that's one of the really brilliant takeaways from that book.

And then you see, well, of course that's by five, of course. That's the character he writes in all of his, uh, uh, writing in shows. Um, Sense8 is, is all about that. It's about flawed people trying to find not only the better version of themselves, but also understand that that's, that everybody's going through something.

Um. So I really, I really appreciate that in the writing. If JMS ever hears this, like, I want, I want him to hear that part, you know, that we see, we see that part in his work, uh, and that part and that part of him, and going back quickly to the father thing. Even Delenn at one point brings up her father.

It's, it's, it's a, it's beautiful moment. Yeah. I, I just re-watched that in, in an episode where Sheridan wants to know more about her. She tells this other story to Sheridan, which is They would go to Temple every day, the Minbari, the religious cost and everything. And one day her father puts her down and says, Delenn, you are too old for me to carry.

You must now walk on your own. And she describes that moment of her childhood as such a defining moment because she saw in her father not only his love for her, but the acknowledgement that things, that he's getting older, she's getting older, that life has changed. And for the first moment she realized that her father was mortal.

That he would one day pass and at no. And that she loved him no more than at that moment they just connected. And I thought, wow, I mean. Yeah, you don't expect, you don't always expect those moments in this show. You don't expect it from the trailers and everything else. And then you get a moment like that.

[00:32:43] **JOSH:** Next week Babylon 5.

[00:32:45] **JOHN:** Yep.

Yeah, it's, you know, this is, this is the whole thing. And this is why I, why I love how we do go down the rabbit holes when discussing this, is that, this show would've been great just having the story that it had, just having the shadow war, the station, it's, it's the crazy goings on that would've actually been enough to, for it to be a really good show.

What actually makes it really great, is these moments, because that's what I take away. I say, you know, I can forgive some of the special effects when I get a little bit like, oh, that didn't quite work. Or, some of the moments don't quite work. It's because these moments really work. Because like, why do we, why are we, why do we love Delenn?

And Delenn is written in a way, and this is where we could do again, a whole episode, she has obviously a feminine energy and a strength that you would never want to have to go up against because you will lose. And that when we get to that in severed dreams, oh my God, that, that, that's when every goosebump goes, you know, when in that moment, and yet she can be so

tender at the same time, and so incredibly powerful and, and often ruthless if she needs to be as well. And there was no like, oh, but this is better than the other. We have to diminish one to have the other. The Sheridan/Delenn relationship as it evolves is one of total equals who 

[00:33:58] **JOSH:** Mm. 

[00:33:59] **JOHN:** also bring all kinds of different things to the table.

And you, they could really get to explore it because you have Minbari human, you know? So you're gonna have that, but it's really a great way. And there isn't this, um, chauvinism, from either, either side. You just get to appreciate it all. And, think I took, I took a lot of that away. That's why when I revisit this show, I really, I get, I get to re-experience that.

I get to re-experience. Why, why did they fall in love? Like what is that like? Um, and then what's it like to be at the be in the positions they're in, which is power, you know, they, they, they end up with enormous amounts of power and none of them are like, they're accused of it, but none of them are, neither one of 'em is going after power for the sake of power.

And we had that great discussion about, uh, uh, you know, Comes the Inquisitor, you know? Yes, there is, there's almost a little bit. He was, he was inquiring and, and pushing them and torturing them on the idea to see how delusional they were. Delenn has that moment. And she breaks whether, she might've had a little bit of delusion to begin with, because again, you almost, you need that, you need a little bit of delusion to get you into these roles.

I've always heard that to be a great. Whether it's a startup or a visionary or even a great scientist, you have to have a little bit of delusion, but not enough to poison you. And then she breaks a moment and says, but another will replace me. It's not just about me. She, she had to come to grips with that to realize it's not all about Delenn either, but she passed a test.

As a result. Most or a lot of people in those positions of power can't pass that test because to them, as you said, they're connected. They are the state, they are the cause. Whatever the cause is, it is them. And that's not our two main characters here. Uh, they, they, they, numerous, at numerous points are willing to sacrifice themselves, but also to say, yeah, I also have to hand it over to somebody else.

At some point. I have to, I have to trust other people. This episode is about trust and the, uh, the breaking of trust as you get towards the end, uh, with the Nightwatch and, and, and the crew on board. Um, and, and, and that's something I, I don't think if, if you think it's all about you, you can become more paranoid and you're not gonna be able to trust somebody else because how could you trust anybody?

I mean, President Clark was there at the end alone. Who could he trust? Really, in the end? Who could President Trust Clark? Trust Nobody. And, and that's what I worry about. I see the same tendencies with our current president, is that he certainly doesn't appear to trust anybody. He, he uses people. He temporarily trusts people who are, who are in his court and who are very, uh, uh, flattering, uh, uh, of him.

And, uh, and again, the, the notion of you don't wanna, you're not gonna psychoanalyze somebody, but the well-documented part from family members and biographies about his family is that he had the opposite father. He had a brutal father who, who destroyed his brother. 

And, uh, he was raised in a way to compete with everybody. His siblings have no real self-worth. Um, it, it sounds like a brutal, awful childhood. You can understand the man he is, you part because of that. And the counter example is, oh, if you're gonna be a good leader, cha, there may be that you had good examples in your life, if not a father, a father figure, somebody that you looked at and said, here is strength and compassion wielded together.

[00:37:17] **JOSH:** I'm really gonna go out on a limb here. Do you think people who support him or voted for him had that example of leadership from their father or their mother their apparent figure versus, those who see Trump and are horrified and are like, nothing about that man is appropriate for leader of anything. Maybe they had apparent example more along the lines of, David Sheridan. Obviously this isn't really something that can answer definitively. It just made me wonder if you see that and that's an acceptable model of leadership, to you, you know, enough to cast a vote for it and or still support it.

I was talking to a friend of mine, who I've known for a long, long time. his parents are very conservative and they, support Trump. And the other day asked him, I was like, have you talked to your parents about what they think about this tariff stuff? And he was like, they think that, the short term pain is gonna be worth it.

And they, trust whatever he's doing is right. And my friend was like, what I say to them is that they just want a, like, stern father to tell them what to do. And that's why they believe anything he says. And they will go along with anything he says. And it's interesting because we're talking about, how the personalities and choices that somebody makes, whether or not it trickles down to the next generation. Some people, like for JMS was able to break the cycle. And, you know, my friend, He does not share at all the beliefs of his parents. know, we can sit here and be like, well, you know, I believe in this and I believe in that. right. But why do you believe that? Where did you get that from?

How did you get there? Was it something you did? Was it another experience that you had? was it in spite of, or was it because of you saw that style, you saw what that was and that made you not wanna be like that? But as you say, trauma begets trauma. hurt people. Hurt people. So what is the difference there?

[00:39:32] **JOHN:** there's. 

[00:39:32] **JOSH:** easy question.

[00:39:34] **JOHN:** There's the cartoon. And first of all, say, I'm gonna say my, my response to your question is anecdotally yes, I do, I do believe that. I think there, I think that that's from my perspective, my experience and, and the people I know in my life to make that sort of, uh, broad generalization as to populations, we could find some data on that.

Not about Trump per se, but about the nature. Particularly when looking at the Third Reich and others. There is some good information out there and research about, well, how do people come to, who are the people who are most likely, it's not a universalization, it's not, it's, it's not deterministic.

[00:40:09] **JOSH:** Right, right.

[00:40:10] **JOHN:** We say hurt people.

Hurt people as a generalization, because that's what we call a trend. That's why we look at that and say, that's why we want to change the trend. We wanna change what's going on. Not because it's literally everybody. Um, but that, yes, that's the trend line, is that there, there, there is something like that.

And this cartoon that comes to mind is one that was drawn. It was, you know, it was, from generation to generation, you see the different, uh, you know, different forms that abuse takes, whether it's physical, psychological, et cetera. And then, uh, the, the most recent parent you see is wielding a shield.

And you just see like the words trauma coming in as arrows while they. Wield the shield to, to, to shield their child against that incoming, the trauma arrows or, or whatever that is. And I thought that was a neat cartoon that sort of showed us that yes, at some point somebody will make a choice. Maybe it's because they had a different influence in their life, or I, I've encountered parents who have literally said, this is what happened to me.

I resolved not to let that happen to my children. And that's a very human instinct. So, so, you know, never to be discounted that just, just because it is likely, more likely than not that somebody who's who is hurt is gonna hurt somebody else. It means that, but it's also out there that somebody will make the opposite choice, and they're both fundamentally human.

When you're looking at it on a more population level, you know, you ask yourself, how did that substantial number of people vote for Hitler, the Nazi party? You know, we, we, we've explored this a number of times in the show. Did it mean that that entire population was just an, a bunch of evil people? And that, that, well, that that's an evil culture and evil people and evil part of the world.

No, that's not how it works. but there is something in a lot of people, and does, does it trace back to their version of hierarchal thinking and their father figures, their parental figures, their figures of authority in their childhoods? Oh, I, I would certainly bet on that. I think that I, I, I see a lot of people who say, you know, because it was done to me.

It needs, you know, it'd be done against. I, I, I can think of horrific examples of that when you think of certain, uh, uh, cultural practices. Um, and, and here's a dark one that, that is a clear example of one that's done, uh, is when you think of genital mu mutilation, -----uh, it is carried out by the people that was done by to the next generation.

That's, that's the worst type of thinking of, well, because it was done to me, it must not only be normal, but I must carry it on. As awful as it is, as awful as what I went through was I will carry it on, on a smaller level, it becomes, as he said, well that's what it is. Life is about stern leaders. I respect that.

Maybe they lacked that in their life. I think sometimes when, when you lack a a, a reliable authority figure in your life, you look for a reliable authority figure. And, and Trump is, if anything, reliably authoritarian. So if you're looking for somebody who's gonna always tell you what to do, he'll be the one.

He will always be willing to tell you what it is, uh, even if he changes his mind day to day. But what he will say it authoritatively.

[00:43:21] **JOSH:** The other thing too, that's probably a comfort to someone who was lacking that is that because he is also reliably transactional, you know exactly what to do to get his love.

[00:43:32] **JOHN:** Yes. Yes.

[00:43:34] **JOSH:** You know? So if you wanna make him happy, you know exactly how to do it. And it's interesting too because, another kind of feature of authoritarian leaders is their reliance on family. You know, installing them as part of their, um, their government. because, you know, you were saying with, Clark at the end, like, who could he trust? well, someone that, you know, you have control over someone that, you know, you have a sort of unbreakable, relationship with you know, blood is, is thicker than water or what have you, are your own kids. And that's why, You've got all of his kids and you've got their spouses, and you've got the brothers-in-law and you've got like the whole thing.

It's becoming a family operation.

[00:44:19] **JOHN:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:44:21] **JOSH:** the family is firmly, embedded in the official like state apparatus it's just another, layer. 

[00:44:28] **JOHN:** And it goes beyond loyalty. It goes beyond familial loyalty. It's that you, when you're the patriarch, you've been manipulating these people your entire life, their entire lives, their entire lives

[00:44:39] **JOSH:** You molded them,

[00:44:40] **JOHN:** to be something. And, and that means that the chances of them being, you'll know their tells, you'll know what, what they're up to.

Um, it makes them far more easy to manipulate, And, and that's, I mean, that, that's Shakespearean. I mean, there, there, there's nothing new about that. That's, and, and then eventually, yes, it, it is possible. They're the ones to turn on you, but they're using your same playbook, you know? King Lear.

[00:45:05] **JOSH:** that much harder for them to get there,

[00:45:07] **JOHN:** Yeah.

Yep. not just a, a professional relationship or a or whatever. It's like

Yep.

[00:45:14] **JOSH:** it's deeply, deeply psychological.

[00:45:17] **JOHN:** And you said in, in a modern era with the not so fictional show, as it turns out, a succession, you know, you see that with the Murdoch empire, which is largely responsible for aiding Trump's rise and the way the children are played off each other. Now that that is turning into a far more king, Lear like scenario.

I mean, almost, almost page by page. And now the children are fractured. But, the intent was to create a dynasty of people that Murdoch is trying to reach out. You know, when, when he does perish from the grave with his trust to make sure that the way he had news has NewsCorp now must be the same way. It will always be so that even when he, when he finally faces his mortality, that what he created will always be the same and his children are extensions of him and a version of immortality.

That, that, that's a story as old as time.

[00:46:05] **JOSH:** Do you think that this whole thing, a part of it, a part of what drives these authoritarians and to merge with the state is really a fear of death?

[00:46:16] **JOHN:** Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. I, I, I think that that's been well documented in the, in the biographies of many, uh, uh, uh, powerful leaders, especially dictators. Um.

[00:46:25] **JOSH:** I'm sorry. How small are these people? It's, it's so funny. It's almost as if. their, their minds, their imaginations are so small that they have to like broaden their material reality as much as possible. And it's just so crazy. It's like, I don't know,

[00:46:47] **JOHN:** Small, small is a good word for it, because you, because when you imagine the inner lives of especially the worst of the worst dictators, they've 

in the and, and the I've read years, they, they are very small. The inner lives are so minimal. And, and yes, there are leaders who wielded a lot of power and had incredibly detailed inner lives.

But we're talking more about the, the ones that are specifically authoritarian with the, with a level of, you know, uh, control that they, that, that they have. And I look around the world's leaders now, who, who, who resemble that. And they all seem to be the same way. You know, none of them have it now. Now, now, the joke about, the joke about, and also the historical irony when, when people do talk about Adolf Hitler, is that he was a painter.

And was an artist. And that in many ways be theories that, well, maybe if he had been more successful or been able to express himself or that he wouldn't have ended up a genocidal, ruthless, uh, dictator. But it's interesting. It looks like a pathway was cut off for him. At the very least, a pathway of expression and understanding.

And it went entirely internal to this very, very well grand limited version. I mean, that's what we see now with, with Trump is it's a very limited vision. It's grand, it's make America great, make us dominant. But it's, but it's no more detailed and no more intricate than, than just us. Be strong, control everybody else, because we're the best.

That's, that's the beginning, middle, and end of it. There's no more, there's no more to MAGA. It's, that's just it. And you think like, is, that's a lack of creativity, but it's also a lack of interest. Like what happens when you get there? Like hypothetically, let's say all this works, the tariffs work, we bring the whole world to make, give us a fair deal, but then we eventually dominate everybody else.

Everybody looks to us and says, ah, how great is America? Like for what reason? Like, what does the world look like? At that point I said, great, now you're in control. Now what? I mean that, that, that's always the question at the next step is that even, you know, I imagine what, what, what if, you know, you know, we, we have historical fiction for what would've happened in World War II if Germany and Japan had had won.

And none of it talks about a golden age. I. It all evolves into infighting. It all ends up being, you know, infighting within the Third Reich and then the Japanese and the Third Reich fighting it out. So it's like, yeah, you need to, the better vision is one that's a lot trickier. Um, the show where it ends with the Alliance and all this, it, it's not a firm solid one thing end of history idea.

It is, oh, it's a, it's an everlasting process, but we're always evolving and learning and changing and, and that's sort of the beautiful part of it. Um, and that's when we get to Deconstruction of Falling Stars, uh, as the, as is what I call the first series finale really, um, uh, is, is that it, it explores that and doesn't obsess with this idea that, yep, you just dominate and you win and then, and then the game's over and aren't you happy?

Like, no, what's the feeling you get when you finish a video game, you feel accomplished for a while, and then you're like, well, I'm bored now. Like, the same is gonna be af after like, you know, just another conquering like, great, what have you done the cent to in the show? Never seem happy. They're always, they end up ing somebody else and then they have to go back in and do more, you know, a court intrigue and, and what do we have now in the White House, but more and more court intrigue and now they're in fighting over these tariffs.

It's really, and it gets really tedious as, as a citizen here.

[00:50:08] **JOSH:** that's one word for it. Yeah.

[00:50:10] **JOHN:** Yeah. Like it's fun to watch. If you're watching like a dramatic soap opera, that's one thing, but when it's the real world, you're like, oh, you gotta be kidding me. Another more of this.

[00:50:20] **JOSH:** Well, yeah. 'cause also in a soap opera, they cut out all of the boring parts on the repetition.

[00:50:25] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[00:50:26] **JOSH:** Uh, just, one thing I want to throw at you before we move on from this, maybe Hitler was a bad, painter because he had a small mind

[00:50:35] **JOHN:** Yeah, yeah. That's possible 

[00:50:36] **JOSH:** just saying, just saying,

[00:50:40] **JOHN:** Oh man. It is, It is a thing that, you know, everybody asks like, how does this happen? How does this happen again? And it's human psychology. It, it all comes back to that. And the examples people have and what do they have in life? And fiction gives us a lot of archetypes. I mean, that's, that's Joseph Campbell, that's Star Wars, that's everything.

We, we see the archetypes and they persist through time for a reason. And to identify something that I did going into this episode, I did not expect that this would be a large topic. And here we are. Like, one of the most profound moments of this episode is realize, is our realization about his father and what that means because he, he, he becomes not, he, he becomes in essence a father to the Alliance.

Um, and and there you go. I mean, that, that's sort of the brilliance of like, the idea of like, yes, but he only has 20 years to live, you know, there.

[00:51:33] **JOSH:** It's a term limit. It's a built in term limit is what it is.

[00:51:36] **JOHN:** You know, and, and, and he takes it so, so like, and, and he wants to live as well, you know, like, and do things in life. So it, it's a really interesting, you know, notion around that. So, you know, I think, yeah, as we sort of, you know, wind our way back to the meat and potatoes of this episode, um, you do get, you do get the sense that, that, yeah, he's not looking to conquer anybody.

He, he makes this decision now that he knows what earth is up to, that they have access to a shadow vessel, that they are going to try to merge somebody with it and get control of it and, and, and, and use it. And then not only would that be, and they're thinking not only from the tactical perspective, that that is a big problem.

Obviously, if, if, President Clark has access to shadow technology, that's a huge advantage for the authoritarian, no doubt. But they know what the actual ramification is. Is that what it means, is that that shadow, that's a shadow vessel, he's not gonna get control of it. It's gonna cause death, destruction, and chaos.

[00:52:35] **JOSH:** Well, there was a line that really stood out to me when the shadow vessel is awake and they're there in the white star. and you know, the white star is a new experimental ship and they're talking about, they're not sure how they're gonna fare against the shadow vessel. And Sheridan says, will last a lot longer than an earth ship will against that thing.

so even then in that moment, he's trying to protect,

[00:52:56] **JOHN:** Yes.

[00:52:57] **JOSH:** he wants to save lives, whereas, you know, is another course of action you could make justifications for, you could certainly imagine another commander, making the decision to be like, okay, well we try and we failed. Let's get out of here and let the shadow vessel do whatever it's gonna do and see how that plays out.

[00:53:14] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[00:53:15] **JOSH:** though. It would probably end up, know, making the authoritarian impulses even worse, not like they needed any help, because they use this very incident to justify declaring martial law at the end of the episode. So.

[00:53:26] **JOHN:** That's the thing that, that's the end here. Like this episode. Is it this, this, this is where martial law happens. They, the, the shadow ship, which they wanted in the first place is then used when, when they failed to gain control of it. Is used as the pretext for martial law. That's, that's the part where you, you start the episode with the percussion, you end it with the, oh boy.

It happened, like everything we've been tr hoping we would avoid happened, at least start on earth now, is that the Earth Alliance is under martial law. The orders will eventually come into Babylon 5. And as a viewer, you're just left with like, I mean there's no other way to put it than you're just like, oh shit.

Like I thought that they would derail this by now or you know, or that maybe, you know, going up against the shadow vessel, something would wake people up. Nope. There their Sheridan is, he makes that, and I wanna go back to it. When he makes the decision to do this, he takes off his badge and he's like, okay listen, I gotta like wipe out the fact that my identity is in any way associated with this.

He's not doing it to be the acclaimed hero. He's living up to that inquisition moment and being like, okay, we, we, we have to go do this. We didn't wanna have to do this. This isn't, may not even help us oppose Clark. It's just that if we don't do it, no one else will. And the cost will be so great to innocent lives and into the future.

So he does it and he goes off and even in the throes of it, when they're hoping to disable the shadow ship and then realizes, nope, it wakes up. They're fighting it now. He's just as interested in saving the Earth Alliance cruisers. You know, I think, you know, and he sees his old ship, right? He doesn't want them to needlessly suffer, even though they're aiding and abetting Clark, you know, he's not approaching at the standpoint of I have to wipe out my enemies.

He's approaching it from the standpoint of I have to have these bigger ideals and I still care about these people and I'll risk myself for that. And he does. And the white star, fortunately is able to handle the gravity well of Jupiter better than a shadow, a vessel due to, due to physics. It's, it's a really cool, uh, uh, special effects moment.

But there we are. We think, we think as viewers, oh, we can breathe for a moment. They, they, they got rid of the shadow vessel, didn't have to destroy an earth cruiser. they can go home now, like next episode. Nope. Even though they did the right thing, they won the day. That was the pretext Clark used to say, holy crap, look, everybody, look at these alien vessels.

Look at these things. We are under threat. We must declare martial law. We have to protect you. And yeah, you know what, that's the bullshit of today. That is the bullshit of today. That, that is the, the complete mass hallucination that is the freak out on immigration and I'll just go look full in on this because, because we're, we're, we're April 9th when we're recording this right now. And that's been the pretext for a lot of things. But on day one of this administration, the executive order regarding the border was issued. And, and this is making its way over the internet right now, and whether it comes to pass or not, we will see.

But the, this fact is true in that executive order, he wanted a report from the Secretary of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security Chiefs, on what, not only to do about the southern border, but it specified specifically and whether or not the insurrection act should be invoked as part of that process.

Now, knowing who those two people are, we can guess the answer will very likely be yes. Now, that was a 90 day timer put on that. So that brings us to April 20th. So

on or after April 20th, there will be a report from the Secretary of Defense, department of Climate and Security as to whether or not to invoke the Insurrection Act, to deal with this, with the southern border and, and obviously creating it situation that is so, so threatening that it is literally equivalent to a war.

and most people don't understand what a war really is. I mean, a war is, I mean, war is war. It's not, this is not that. And so, yeah, that's the pretext use something. You, you, you amp it up, you amp up the fear around something, and then you use martial law. Because the Insurrection Act is literally the tool by which a US president can use the military of the United States for domestic law enforcement.

It's the only law that gives the president that authority. And if they are getting what we anticipate will be the broad recommendation of the two amongst the two most cabinet members to do so, that will open up a floodgate to say anything related, even conceptually to border enforcement means we can use the US military anywhere in US territory.

Never, never been done to that level before. Never. I mean, and, and the last time we really had the Insurrection Act invoked like this, um, as, as I will quote another sci-fi luminary, \\ George Decay when he's talking about this, you know, one of the last times the Insurrection Act was, was utilized to his full extent, was to in tern all those Japanese descent in the United States into intern camps, into effective concentration camps.

I mean, we did that. it's the biggest black mark on FDR R'S record. And that was the act it was used for. And the difference is we were in an active world war at that point on two fronts. Not justifying at all, but saying like, like, that was an actual war. Here. There's not even an actual war. And that's gonna be used against

everybody. What, what, what would the limit be if that were, like, if that were to take place, and this is, this is the warning that's going out from people and yes, it's making its way across social media and you want to say, well, what's real and what's not? But we, that is what the executive order said very clearly.

So the pretext for an order that involves martial law is 11 days away. that's, that's how it is. And I, I, I still s saying it out loud feels surreal because I still couldn't imagine, I think the way that the characters on the show couldn't imagine, they'll never actually do that. Why would he do that?

There's not even a reason to do that. But here we are.

[00:59:19] **JOSH:** yeah. You know, there's that scene with Ivanova and Marcus, where Ivanova kind of blows up at Marcus, and she also has the self-awareness to basically be honest and say, yeah, I'm mad at you because we shouldn't have to be doing this.

[00:59:35] **JOHN:** Yes.

[00:59:36] **JOSH:** also because I don't have anyone else to blame. Which felt very real to me.

this shouldn't be happening and I'm really angry about it and I am just going to reach for the nearest, scapegoat shaped thing and yell at that. I mean, obviously the prospect, of the military, being used as essentially a domestic police force is, is chilling.

And I don't really have much else to say about that prospect, except, um, yeah, it's hard to wrap my head around that one. Uh, what it made me think of was, there's a brilliant line. I think it's an original line. I don't think he's paraphrasing something else, but in another. sci-fi show. the rebooted Battlestar Galactica, commander Adama has a line.

There's a reason you separate military into police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes the police and the enemies of the state tend to become the people. Ironically though, in a situation like this, that's the idea, they already see the people as the enemies of the state,

[01:00:39] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[01:00:39] **JOSH:** because whoever's opposing Trump, who again, he is the state, they're an enemy of the state because they're an enemy of Trump. so yeah, not great.

[01:00:50] **JOHN:** it's one of the moments where like in, in doing this show, I didn't really expect there to be as many direct parallels. I thought it was be more of an intellectual exercise

starting off and more of a slow moving train of, of warning signs and interesting, uh, uh, interesting things. And, and again, this would be, you know, just, oh yeah, that's, that's, that's a, uh, podcast.

You know, What I'm shocked at is, is not only the parallels, but the actions that are happening live, in front of us. And, and, and this being one of them. And again, I, I try to pay attention to a lot of things. I didn't know the details of this executive order until fairly recently.

I didn't know what the 90 day timer meant for that. And, you know, while we don't know what the ramifications of it are, we know under the mechanics of law, if there's only one way that is clearly legal without, without just doing this, but he is looking for it, you know, to use the military domestically

then that is very likely the path they're going to follow. And what follows from that. You use it one day for that. Then there's a protest. Use the military for that. You, it, it has to expand, uh, until you give up. Now South Korea in modern times, recent obviously in the last couple weeks, faced a similar scenario where their president quite literally declared martial law again, this isn't fiction, this isn't like, oh, we're all exaggerating stuff.

And, uh, was very quickly re reputated by, by their parliament, including many members of his own party. was then impeached and removed, and just recently the courts upheld his removal. Um, so South Korea sort of reacted in real time to preserve what they had of a democracy, what they have of a democracy, uh, against a president who was citing emergency after emergency and, and things that were not really real.

They were real, but they weren't anywhere near the level that justified some sort of martial law. It, it was a power grab. It was, it, it was arroGanymedece and it was fear. Some people equate that to like, you know, the immune system kicking in and, and then purging. That's not happening here right now. We do see protests.

We do see a lot of, obviously a lot of reporting and, and, and media that, that, that is countering the narratives coming from the administration and trying to stand up for a lot of democratic values. But it's, but there isn't, as far as I can tell, an easy, systematic way to react against an invocation of the Insurrection Act.

[01:03:19] **JOSH:** Yeah, I mean you would hope that somewhere in the military there's a General Hague or several general hagues who would stand up and say, nuh, we aren't doing this. I also have to believe that like the rank and file, like, you know, people on the ground that like a lot of them would not be very comfortable with all this.

I mean, again, obviously if you're at the bottom of the chain of command like that, there's not really much, you can do except to, you know,

[01:03:42] **JOHN:** Follow orders are, you know, the, are pretty much your, your, your, your choices. And, and then, you know, what we don't have insight into is, you know, what is, what has the recruitment been like for the military? How much are they recruiting from the ultra maga sort of scarier groups that I won't list on here, So we don't know that makeup, but the, but the interesting the fiction and the reality diverge is that term number one involved a lot of pushback from the military, brass, a lot of pushback from the joint chiefs to leadership, et cetera. And then there was the election, a new president's elected, there's an attempt to overturn that result on January 6th.

And everybody was so aghast, on the middle and the left, and even some on the right, uh, that it seemed inconceivable that it would be a second term. And so it didn't really seem like more safeguards were being actively put in, uh, uh, that we would've expected because it, it, it seemed like, oh, we got through that.

[01:04:40] **JOSH:** Yeah,

[01:04:42] **JOHN:** And to come back now, four years later, it means that as opposed to an extension of the first four years, we get a new four years reset with all the knowledge of how to appoint loyalists and purge the institutionalists who are categorized as the deep state. And that's something that's very different from the fiction here, which is that you're, you, you have a three year time horizon, really two year time horizon from when President Clark ascends to the presidency, um, and is trying to put loyalists.

So where the general hagues are, where the senators are, well they've, they, they've been there for years and years and years and years. And they, and, and even as he purges them at the very shortly after this with martial law, it was a process that, you know, he, he was taking against well-established norms that had been there.

He'd only been there for two years. This is a case of coming back and knowing exactly what to do in round two. So I don't know how many loyalists there are left. You have to hope that they're being very quiet. If they're, if you're smart, you would be very quiet. 'cause you know, the moment you say anything that could be perceived as not towing a line, you would be pushed out.

I mean, the other day, the NSA chief was removed, a military uniformed officer because a conspiracy theorist met in the o in, in the Oval office and said, these aren't loyalists to you. It's a different, it's a different dynamic than what the show portrayed because even, even later in the Season 3, uh, they, they say, well, contrary to what you may be told, the resistance is alive and well, that was when the, uh, the religious leaders come on board to meet with Brother Theo.

Uh, and a moment I'd also forgotten about that. So, you know, there in real time, there's some advantages over what President Clark had access to. Fortunately, there are no shadows involved, uh, as far as we know, uh, in this case. Unfortunately, there are no alien races or Vorlons there to help us out either. that would sort of be the nice part is to know that the, uh, that maybe Delenn and her Minbari cruisers were there to at least defend the breakaway station of Babylon 5, as opposed to, you know, whatever it would be here today.

Yeah. 

[01:06:47] **JOSH:** You know, my sort of rising fear from, 2021 through 2024 was, it seemed to me like the necessary response to close the door on what had just happened from spreading any farther, was not happening. In retrospect, it seems like the hope was return to the status quo would just solve everything rather than, perhaps extreme measures from some people's perspective.

but real serious steps had to be taken to really, put the kibosh on that whole thing. You know, the idea that, Trump never even went to trial. You know, we had four years. I.

[01:07:31] **JOHN:** The, the, there are four years, there's, there, there's a lot of criticism to be leveled against, the people involved in, that, whether it's Merrick Garland and his very much slow walking to do by the, you know, he claims it was to do by the book, but it was very much a, slow walking of a process because the underlying assumption was that that was so far out there that it was inconceivable that it would happen again, not realizing that that was in fact the opening salvo.

That, that, that, that, that opened everything up to what would happen next.

[01:07:58] **JOSH:** No, and it's also, we, we already had seen, lived through how far they were willing to go. He was willing to go. So the only way to counter that is to rise up to meet it rather than say, oh, okay, if we just, you know, return to what we were doing before and not, make too much of a fuss, they'll just go away and everything will, politely resolve itself.

It's, it's, it's almost as if, there was so much faith or the onus was, put so much on the institutions to do the job for us rather than. Realizing it's really the people who work within those institutions to up and do something.

[01:08:42] **JOHN:** Yeah. And, and they weren't, they, they certainly weren't prepared back in the Weimar Republic. and, and surprisingly despite our 240 something year history, uh, they weren't really willing to do all that much in the four years after, January 6th. And that's, and that's a real indictment of the mindset, around that.

And, and a lack of vision too. It, it, it's, it's sort of like, have you folks never read history or have you never read a book, fictional history of anything that maybe would've, you know, given you perspective to say, Hey. A return to the status quo. Well, in fact, the status quo gave us this in the first place, like a status quo birthed to the first administration.

So a return to that would simply imply that you're going to get another one. and I think that's the, that's, we talked about delusion earlier. there's just as much delusion that comes from the respect for the status quo as the savior of all things. it's that don't rock the boat.

Everything's fine. When you looked at the attempt to shore up voting rights and pass a new voting rights act, you had two senators, uh, uh, in the center who were, who then declared independence, who opposed any kind of filibuster reform on, on the grounds that it would empower the other side too much.

Now, while it's holding right now, in theory, we have still have a filibuster in the Senate. It's not gonna mean much of anything a couple months from now. but they thought, oh, well, we don't, we don't wanna bypass that to make sure that voting rights are secured, or anything else like that because, that itself would, would undermine whatever, you know, their concept of what majority rule was about.

But I said, but there was a, there was such a fragile vision that they had where they didn't see or we're deliberately blind to what had already happened and that we'll try again.

[01:10:25] **JOSH:** It is almost as if the first Trump term was so hard for a lot of people to wrap their heads around that they never quite reckoned with what that actually meant. And when it went away, it must have felt like, see, That was an aberration. Not gonna happen again.

[01:10:47] **JOHN:** Right,

[01:10:48] **JOSH:** We don't have to reckon with that because it's gone. Um, they never actually saw it for what it was and followed the, um, the 

thought process through to its logical, obvious conclusions.

[01:11:02] **JOHN:** They, they certainly didn't. They certainly didn't. But they didn't in 2016, whether it was the, ironically it's involves Mayor Garland again was the appointment under the Supreme Court and saying, yeah, but this is all gonna be normalized like Clinton wins, we get our power. It it, it was, it was this a very arrogant assumption, that happens and that's, and that's what open, that's what leaves any civilization open to an authoritarian is this sort of bland a of a ruling group that doesn't think that the norms will ever change.

[01:11:32] **JOSH:** And I also think, frankly, it also comes back around to a lack of imagination. Right. and, you know, the last, point I wanna make, I wrote this down in my notes, but it kind of has a little more significance in light of what we were saying about, authoritarians and their small or narrow view of the world. when Garibaldi visits G'Kar in prison,

[01:11:56] **JOHN:** Mm-hmm.

[01:11:57] **JOSH:** you know, which is a wonderful scene and I always really like the relationship between G'Kar and Garibaldi for some reason. but, uh, you know, G'Kar, he's incarcerated for attacking Lando. he's also trying to grapple with the, the revelation that he had.

And he's trying to write all of it. into what will, become, the book of G'Kar later on. But something that he says to Garibaldi who is surprised that G'Kar seems to be really enjoying his incarceration and his solitude, and G'Kar is saying that everything that's out there is a distraction

[01:12:31] **JOHN:** Mm-hmm.

[01:12:32] **JOSH:** and it's all designed to distract us from ourselves. And he says there is much to be learned from silence. And so what G'Kar is doing is that thing that authoritarians, at least in the mold of the Trumps and the the ones with these small minds who seem to be operating in the way that they do, is they are unwilling to just sit and face themselves and face the world without any mediation, you know, without any distractions, without any, you know, material, considerations. You know, G'Kar has been broken down and he is processing that in silence, no distractions. and I just think it's quite a contrast to, the kinds of people who, who are unwilling to, um, you know, self-reflect and really try to, look around and, take stock of the world of themselves to really try to, reckon with what actually is there when you get rid of all the distractions. with as much humility as possible, I think that's the only way that you can do it,

[01:13:45] **JOHN:** Hmm.

[01:13:46] **JOSH:** is with humility. And yeah, and I just think a lot of people are unwilling to self-reflect to the degree that is necessary. And I think it creates all sorts of delusions about how to avoid that fear of the end of life and how it doesn't make sense and, you know, bad things happen to good people, et cetera, et cetera.

You know, and if you can just control it, then you don't have to face that fear. But as G'Kar would probably tell you that control is an illusion.

[01:14:24] **JOHN:** Yeah. mean, his character has written, goes through that, through that point of, of, of trying to use for, uh, pure force of will and strength to control the world around them, to make it make sense, to then be broken open first, be broken down, and then be broken open. That that doesn't, that won't, get him where he needs to be.

And I think that's one of the most difficult parts to realize is that so many people in power, but particularly those who end up becoming dictators and authoritarians, they stay locked on that delusion. They, their minds stay forever small. Um, I've never, not, I can't say never, but it's rare that I've found the writings of such people to be particularly interesting if they had any at all.

Um, in the case of the current president, we don't have anything outside of, we, we have his tweets. He writes a lot of tweets and that can tell you all you need to know right there. Um, but in terms of the, you know, of everything else, yeah. It's just amazing how, easy it is to, believe that if, if, if one gets to that level, they must be a combination of brilliant and deep and function.

People will think that, oh, he's operating on four dimensional chess here. That's the game that it's actually not, there isn't that much going on there. There, there's one technique being tried over and over and over again, and sometimes it works. And that is to play the crazy man leader who's willing to blow it all up to get the deal.

I. And sometimes that works in business, sometimes it doesn't. And he got a few small victories in this in the first term, using that technique as we discussed earlier in the episode, uh, you know, China's adapted to that. So it, it remains to be seen, but I think with a low probability that his current techniques on the on, on the tariff and the trade war will work the way he thinks they will.

That, that, that blustering and having, you know, threaten other people to call your bluff, uh, won't work out the same way. And that shows a fundamental lack of creativity. Like, oh, you're using the same playbook over and over and over again. Like, there's no nuance there. There's no real difference in strategy, which means eventually, uh, somebody will, will, will beat him on the international stage.

you know, and then the question is, does, does he take the Clark route out at the end? Is, is the scary part. uh, obviously when JMS wrote that he was keeping the tradition alive, uh, when it came to President Clark at the end, that in Earth Alliance, Earthdome as well as this country, there is only one way to launch those weapons.

And that is with the president of the United States or the President of the Earth Alliance. That that's it, you know, and you think, my God, that's not the best system. It's like, and, and, and again, you can say like, oh, we, we had years to reform that. There were a lot of, lot of committees that talked about that, that, hey, we need, we need a better process for something like that.

So while that seems, that's a bit of a downer to a close to the end of this on, but it's the, it's the reality. Um, I wonder where the writing on the wall, I mean, if, if when we end this episode, it's, uh, it's sort of where I'm feeling right now. It's the, oh, it's coming. Uh, uh, in that case, Earth Alliance declared martial law.

That's it. You know, like we, we know that's happened now. The one thing we've been trying to avoid, uh, in the show, and it seems again like, like quite a defeat for the main characters. but it's not the end. it's the beginning of the next arc that leads us to severed Dreams. Uh, how many episodes now do we have

one or two episodes before Severed Dreams now?

[01:17:54] **JOSH:** Uh, there's one in between. 

There's, uh, the next episode is, uh, Point of No Return, and then Severed Dreams is after that. Um, this three episode run, uh, Messages from Earth, point of No Return, Severed Dreams, has always been sort of referred to as like a sort of a little trilogy. It's like a,

it's like a, uh, a triptych, I think that comes from JMS himself.

I think he

was from the very beginning. talking about them that way. it's also interesting too, because again, when I was younger, I don't know that I. Was watching this with as much awareness or understanding as I obviously have now, like, I don't know that the martial law decree at the end of this episode was as clear to me that that was a direct result of what Sheridan and Delenn had done in the episode.

[01:18:43] **JOHN:** Interesting. Did it feel more like it was, it was like a, a coincidence,

[01:18:48] **JOSH:** No, not a coincidence. It was just that they were already in the process of doing this.

[01:18:53] **JOHN:** which they, which they were, I mean, that we, we know from what Nightwatch, this is what they were preparing for. They used that as the final launching platform, but it was gonna happen at some point in 

[01:19:02] **JOSH:** Um, yeah, because even at very beginning of Ivanova is, uh, watching ISN and it's just sort of se the ISN anchor is quoting someone from the administration, and in regards, to this new security threat. the quote is, extreme measures may be required, you know, which is a very kind of ominous but vague quote. And what struck me watching it today another way where the reality is actually more outrageous than the fiction because, you know, now they just say, they just say outright.

Exactly, what they're gonna do. It's like, I do think it's an impulse control thing, but also think it's well, let's, put this out there and get everyone used to the idea.

[01:19:46] **JOHN:** Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

[01:19:48] **JOSH:** have people saying like, maybe we'll need to declare martial law.

We'll see, I don't know. I don't wanna do that. But maybe it'll be necessary. And then, people freak out. His supporters say, oh, well he's, he's not serious. Like, he's just talking. But you have a year, two years of that scenario, circulating. 

[01:20:07] **JOHN:** Yep. 

[01:20:08] **JOSH:** people are getting used to that idea.

So when it happens, it's like. you know, you were talking about South Korea before, and again, I haven't, been following that situation as closely. I wasn't, but from an outsider's perspective, seeing the news that we saw and the way that it played out it seemed to me like his mistake was he tried to grab too much too quickly.

[01:20:31] **JOHN:** Hmm. Yeah.

[01:20:32] **JOSH:** Whereas it seems, unfortunately in our situation, the idea that he's just saying stuff, he doesn't mean it.

But in so doing, you are actually softening the ground.

[01:20:43] **JOHN:** Yeah. So that you're, you're, you're peeling people away who would otherwise have been shocked and aghast and you're normalizing that kind of rhetoric. You're normalizing, you're shifting some called the Overton window, is sort of what's generally accepted in discourse and, and political, ideas.

and then most importantly is just the time factor. Uh, and, and of, of knowing, you know, okay, well we, we've spent enough time putting people into the right places. Um, I, I don't even think his first run, he entirely intended to grab that level of power.

[01:21:16] **JOSH:** No. 'cause I think that he and a lot of other people around him weren't actually expecting him to win.

So once they got there, it was sort of, well, okay, now that we're here, how does this work? What should we do? How can 

[01:21:27] **JOHN:** They didn't know, they didn't know how to fly the plane at that point. Now, now they do. Um, and they've been burned. I mean, they, they, you know, their honor's been assaulted, you know, by, by the people. And, and, and they felt they were maligned. He always feels he's un maligned, by, by the pushback he got in the first term.

The irony being, that's the very thing that got him in the first term was, you know, there are some people who say, well, if he hadn't been ridiculed in that, press dinner by President Obama, he never really would've had the thought to run for president. 

[01:21:54] **JOSH:** again, how small, how small a mine must you have for something like that you're the butt of a joke. Then as a result, you make your entire life's project

completely dominating and destroying the world. I mean, basically absolutely insane.

[01:22:13] **JOHN:** yeah. And I feel like every, every teenager's had that moment when something happens to you and somebody makes fun of you or something, and so you just wanna like blow it. You just wanna, like, you imagine like, I will, I will make all the bullies, I'll make everybody respect me no matter what.

And it's this, it's this literal like adolescent grandiosity that is utterly unrealistic and unhealthy. But imagine living in that space your entire life. I think that's what it is,

[01:22:39] **JOSH:** Well, you know, Trump has famously said that, he's the same person he's been since he was in first grade.

[01:22:46] **JOHN:** which is wild. I mean, I, I, I'm not the same person I was in first grade. I'm, I mean, I'd like to think I've grown and changed and.

[01:22:52] **JOSH:** yeah, I mean, not only is that a crazy thing to say and to think, but what that means, the implications of that are actually pretty horrifying. And the worst part about it is that if you look at what he does and what he says through that lens, it makes sense.

[01:23:11] **JOHN:** Yes. That's, that's the unfortunate part. That's the really unfortunate part is that

You wanna believe, you wanna believe that the villains in this world, in any world, are always these incredibly complex, nuanced characters. 

and, and they're not. And, and, and even in this show, they, they didn't bother for a reason. They didn't make Clark much of anything because there wasn't meant to be much of him. he wasn't the antagonist for a reason. you know, at different times, Londo was an antagonist, incredibly layered, incredibly nuanced.

Uh, he has to redeem himself. He doesn't redeem himself, goes back and forth. Clark has given nothing. He's given one or two lines in the entire show. I. Pictures, and then it's just the, the, the story built around, uh, who he is. And, and that's because that's the kind of person he is. That's the kind of person he's meant to be.

Um, he's not nuanced, particularly interesting, uh, or even particularly ultimately relevant, in the sense of it could have been anybody with his mindset that would've been just as easily a tool with the shadows. that that's why he had to link himself to everything, because he didn't matter that much.

and, and certainly the shadows weren't gonna be like, oh, thank God we got this guy and power. We finally have our, uh, our, our agenda, working. It's like, no, they're just like, he's another useful tool, for us. Um, I will say, I think a lot of people may are making that mistake now that, that they thought that Trump would be their useful tool.

I think a lot of the wealthy billionaires think a lot of the people, I think a lot of the tech overlords that lined up on the dais on Inauguration Day all thought that if they bent the knee that he would be useful to them. not realizing that, uh, they will come back. I mean, it will come back on them.

Uh, what, what's the phrase everybody uses? Like, people are shocked that when they vote for the party that this platform is leopards eating people's faces. Uh, that, oh my God, leopards start eating people's faces like. you know what you're getting here and then you act surprised. I mean, all these people having surprised the tariffs, he's been saying this for years,

[01:25:10] **JOSH:** on like Larry King in like 1987. He was saying this.

[01:25:14] **JOHN:** Yeah. is. Got a singular obsession, not rooted, in fact, a reality by the way. Uh, certainly not, not anything that, considered, reality, but he's been saying it the entire time, like, don't, get surprised when, when he actually does it. that's also a fundamental lack of imagination.

when you can imagine the worst and hope for the best, you're probably best prepared. But when you're just sitting there like, yeah, no, they won't do what they say they're going to do, 

[01:25:40] **JOSH:** No, and it's also true this idea that he's thought this for like 40 years. The idea that he's seen nothing in the last 40 years. He's read nothing, seen nothing, had no new thoughts, nothing that would change that belief.

[01:25:54] **JOHN:** but he, of course not. You said it before. He's the same person. He's been since first grade. You know, he must obviously loves the idea of being the same person. Pe people call it being consistent. Well, you know what? we have another name for that. Unadaptable.

And, humans can't survive unless we adapt. That's one of the most core components of reality. And sometimes the voters, they punish people who grow and evolve because they say, oh, you, oh, you flip flop. And that's a major 

[01:26:21] **JOSH:** All 

[01:26:22] **JOHN:** on 

Yeah. no, that, that's the point, is you want a leader who, uh, learns and evolves and, and becomes better iterations of themselves.

Um, but if you want somebody who is just, well, I know what he is. Well, you know what he is, the irony is that people are still denying what he's been saying, as if it's not gonna come, true. Um, that's the other thing that I've read over the years that also confirms, is that typically authoritarians tell you exactly what they're going to do.

They're not hiding nearly as much as you think. It's out there in the open. It's just that you have enough people around you who are effectively gaslighting you. And are saying no, don't listen to that part. Like, it's gonna be fine. Don't, don't listen to the reality of it. Um, the answer is always listen.

People will tell you they mean, and what they intend on doing. 

[01:27:09] **JOSH:** There's one final, I promise, final observation that I had, just 'cause I wonder, uh, what you make of it. But, um, I thought the choice of Jupiter was very interesting. and it struck me when I was a kid too. You know, usually on Star Trek, like you never hear about like Jupiter, right? You know, you hear about like, Regula VII or something like that.

[01:27:30] **JOHN:** Mm-hmm. 

[01:27:31] **JOSH:** And I thought having this mission to Ganymede and Jupiter, these like planets that we're familiar with since we're, you know, little kids something to make it hit home in a way. that ironically something like, Coriana 6 and the shadow war resolution does not hit the same way know, that's sort of an abstraction.

It's like, the Zogs from Zog. I don't care about that. But, having this happen in Jupiter really made it feel real in a strange way. And the other thing that as a kid really struck me and kind of gives you a sense of the scale and majesty of the galaxy and the universe, was this idea that Jupiter, the planet was how they destroy a shadow vessel, right? This like knowable real planet that we've known about since we were in kindergarten. Like Jupiter is so massive and powerful that it can take out a shadow vessel. You know, this isn't some crazy super weapon. And if we use the main deflector and we do this and we do that, no, I'm gonna fly right into Jupiter, this planet hanging in your, first grade classroom, And use gravity to crush it because the forces of the real galaxy are orders of magnitude more powerful than you can even imagine. And there's just something about that, that always really resonated with me, like, utilizing the familiarity of Jupiter, drives home how real the threat is.

And also in a way that makes it very distinct from Star Trek. Because with very few exceptions, you're never really seeing planets that we are familiar with in Star Trek. It's always like really far out there with like crazy names. And

[01:29:10] **JOHN:** it was a wild exception when they had an episode on Earth. What the hell? What are they doing?

[01:29:14] **JOSH:** We saw Jupiter in Star Trek The Motion Picture very briefly, which again, kind of an existential threat. And the next time we saw it was in The Best of Both Worlds, facing another existential threat.

[01:29:25] **JOHN:** Yep.

[01:29:26] **JOSH:** And even then I remember the Borg ship is very small compared to Jupiter, 

right? Again, it's like Jesus. Like these planets are massive.

[01:29:36] **JOHN:** Yeah, no, I mean I have to remind myself that that's how big Jupiter is. I mean, Ganymede is well, technically a moon. It's practically a, it is a planet. and in terms of size and, and that's just in our own, backyard. So yeah, I mean, the, the fact that that was used, it was another example of Sheridan, you know, u using, using tactical expertise to take advantage of a situation for a one-time victory.

It wasn't a long-term viable way of winning, but adapting in the moment. doing it with like, yep, there's a thing in our backyard that is more powerful and grand than anything that we can actually, uh, imagine to scale right now. It was also, it was in the solar system. They're in Earth's backyard.

They're that close to being home. The shadow ship is that close that it could wreak havoc on earth, hypothetically, you know, uh, all of that was meant, was meant to be there, for a reason. And we don't get back there for quite a long time. You know, don't have the characters on Mars and Earth until the fourth season.

[01:30:36] **JOSH:** Yeah.

[01:30:37] **JOHN:** You know, when you get to binge watch it, you know, things happen quickly. But we were first time watching this show over the years that it aired, with hiatuses, God, those were awful.

it right in the middle of the shadow war, and then we had to wait, you know, eight weeks to get the resolution. 

[01:30:51] **JOSH:** Yeah. The worst was, those last four episodes, or five episodes of season four. Um, it turned into a cliffhanger, which was, um, I. Intersections in real time.

[01:31:01] **JOHN:** interrogation.

[01:31:02] **JOSH:** Yeah. And then we didn't see the end of the earth Civil War for like, I don't know, six months. It was, it was crazy.

[01:31:09] **JOHN:** It was something crazy. And it was, and it was very unique to the way that that network was airing those. And now we get that with binge watching, like, okay, you get the 10 episode drop, but then you have another finale cliffhanger and you gotta wait two years.

[01:31:20] **JOSH:** Two years. Yeah. 

[01:31:21] **JOHN:** You gotta go back and remember what is happening in your show, at least with Babylon 5, you had enough memory of like, okay, well that was six months ago, or that was three months ago.

So I can generally follow through because outside of you and I recording our VHS tapes, you know, you weren't really going back to rewatch it. You did have your reruns that that was a big thing. Reruns are a big part of life back then. I mean, I've never heard that word 

in years. Rerun. 

like. Not even in our vocabulary anymore.

[01:31:47] **JOSH:** Yeah. I mean, what, what would the context be

where you would use that? That's true. That's a good point. um, I just had a really stupid thought that, um, not at all intentional. It's not, there in the text unless you had the conversation that we just had and you're, and you're looking for it really hard.

But Jupiter is the king of the solar system

the largest of all the planets. Does it say something that Sheridan had to return to the king of the solar system, like

returning to his father to Yeah, I know. I know. I know,

[01:32:21] **JOHN:** I think, I think there's always a lot of layers in writing because we have all these core stories from history into and the imagery is used sometimes deliberately, sometimes subconsciously in the parts of a writer. Um, what I'll say is that it works, you know, using Jupiter. They didn't, they didn't make it, you know, colony X, you know, they made it, there for that.

and it worked. And I, and I appreciate that And, when when I was watching this se rewatching this episode, I was folding laundry at the time. That's how I, I always remember what I was doing when I watch an episode that I have to. Recall later. And I remember just stopping and, I stopped mid fold and was just like staring at the screen for a while.

as the episode was ending, I was like, oh, This was that one. Um, and even in the two weeks since then, I've been like, wait, what happened in this episode again? Oh, that's right. It's that one. It's actually the one where they try, they do the right thing, but at the end it still all falls apart, outside of their control.

And that this is the one where everything that happens in the next season and a half, is because of that martial law declaration. Everything, everything comes from that. Um, and I guess they got in under the wire. They do what they needed to do. It happens and you're left. you're left holding your breath.

Uh, and, and from this point onward in the show, you're holding your breath a lot. Then you do get Interludes and Examinations. You get these, you know, episode flows, but then once you get to four season, you don't really get a chance to breathe.

[01:33:38] **JOSH:** So the fourth season is just, crazy. Like, I remember, watching it late at night because it would be on at like midnight or something. On, on,

[01:33:45] **JOHN:** I.

[01:33:45] **JOSH:** yeah. and just really feeling like I was on a roller coaster, you know? like this was moving and It was 

[01:33:55] **JOHN:** It was almost anything I'd ever experienced on television. Nothing moved that fast. Nothing moved that coherently. that's what was so exciting to watch. I mean, I, I, the only comparison to make was a soap opera in the sense that the ongoing things were relevant from episode to episode.

[01:34:11] **JOSH:** Yeah. And even then, like they were making it up as they 

went along. 

[01:34:14] **JOHN:** still made up.

Yeah. Yeah. This was, oh, wow. they have all this planned out and that, and that's why it was so fulfilling. I love what you brought up earlier, that, that, that all the mysteries, generally speaking, they were solved. Like they, they weren't like this. Okay. Finally, season five, you find out what happened in season one.

It was no, this, this, we're gonna explain this, and few things couldn't be because of changes in the story that were required by production or actor changes or anything like that. But it worked out well. And I'll say this, that the show gave a very satisfying resolution to this story arc in regard to the Earth Alliance.

I would say a slightly less satisfying resolution to the shadow war when we get there. Uh, if only because that was compressed a little bit more than it otherwise had to be. Not dramatically, but I think, I think it was. Um, but e but even that left me watching it of like, oh, I, I saw a few flaws in it, but I was sa I was still satisfied.

I was like, wow. It kept on, it kept on going. I would just say that, you know, you get to season five and you're like, well, you know, if they'd known they'd had the season from the beginning, it would've been better, But, just to be able to experience that, and, I hope there are people who are gonna pick up this show now more and more, because getting to see that and getting be like, wait, something's happening.

Just like we did, like, oh, the story's getting going, and they're like, oh, season one really does have all these interesting layers. And you're like, oh, wait, you haven't even gotten to season two. And then Season 3 

[01:35:28] **JOSH:** Well, you know what's interesting? When you were talking about your friend who's watching it now, and you said that they're just in season one and they're, picking up on all of these layers and nuances, I wonder if, you know, we've sort of been spoiled and trained now to watch TV more closely like that in a way that we weren't 30 years ago.

And the other thing too, you know, not for nothing, from mine and your just personal experience, know, we were much younger. I think we were more interested and engaged with the sort of, uh, more, kinetic 

stuff. Um, versus these smaller character moments. know, I don't know that teens and preteens were necessarily the audience for, for that. Um, but yeah, you know, watching it now, as a fully grown adult, unfortunately, it's really rewarding.

It's so rich. It's such a richly written show. It's really, I mean. Not that he has to hear this again, but, it's really an achievement. It's really quite an achievement that, JMS not only was able to write something of this quality, but that he got it made.

[01:36:34] **JOHN:** That he got it made. Again, the autobiography had some really neat nuggets in there about that towards the end. And he really did have to, uh, keep it under the, keep a lid on it. he didn't tell the studio this was his vision.

[01:36:46] **JOSH:** Yeah.

[01:36:47] **JOHN:** he had to sell it as an episodic Star Trek esque show, that, uh, was apparently ripped off to become Deep Space Nine, which is a great show in its own right.

But learning that there's more information about that is fascinating. And they had to basically not tell them that this was really, his plan 

[01:37:05] **JOSH:** do you know what we should have done for April Fool's Day? We should have, covered a Deep Space Nine episode.

[01:37:10] **JOHN:** Oh man, that would've been great. there are some things to explore in that,

[01:37:13] **JOSH:** No, absolutely. Like that, two-parter in the, uh, in the fourth season. The one where

the one that

[01:37:19] **JOHN:** general Hague is on.

[01:37:21] **JOSH:** Hague is on and why he couldn't be on Severed Dreams. 

[01:37:24] **JOHN:** Yeah. Same time. Isn't that wild? And that's the episode we're thinking about. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:37:29] **JOSH:** You know, if you want to continue this plan, I think last time where we left off was we might hold off Severed Dreams. Is that what you said?

[01:37:37] **JOHN:** If, knock on wood, nothing happens on the 20th or, or thereabouts or on the days immediately following. But that'll be interesting to see. I I, if we're in the throes of something, that approximates it, then we will be right in Severed Dreams. Um, I, I'm also thinking that it could be interesting to do Severed Dreams and then the way that the show sort of has to take a breath after that we can

look at other aspects of the show as well, or continue to go on, but it won't be as quite a, a breakneck pace 'cause it's gonna be a little more, you know, the, the show begins to shift gears towards the shadow war.

[01:38:10] **JOSH:** Yeah, I would like to do an episode on Becoming Superman.

We could bring some other people on and I would, I would like to do an episode of Deep Space Nine for, you know, cheeky reasons. And also it would be interesting to see how that storyline played out on another 90s sci-fi franchise and the way that they handled it.

And it's also interesting too, because, Starfleet never goes there fully.

You know, you get into section 31, but that's like, a few bad apples and they're not supposed to be doing this,

[01:38:39] **JOHN:** And it very much was not what Gene Roddenberry wanted to explore because that was Star Trek VI. You know, it was what happens when the, people in the, Federation council, the Federation, higher ups who quite substantially disagree with policy and are willing to use military means to, have it enforced.

I mean, that's why I think that two parter in Deep Space 9 really does explore that and shows, and it shows you how vulnerable the characters are to thinking along those lines and being like, oh, but that would actually be acceptable and necessary. Um. 

[01:39:06] **JOSH:** Well, it's also interesting too, because

If you take the view of, you know, earth as a paradise in the Star Trek 24th century, those people are so far removed from the conditions that lead this sort of a thing happening that they would be incredibly susceptible.

[01:39:23] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[01:39:24] **JOSH:** The other way is that well, they're so evolved now that they would see it coming from a mile away and they wouldn't let that happen.

[01:39:30] **JOHN:** I think that's what Roddenberry hopes for in Star Trek is that we become evolved. That our, going back to the immune system, analogy, or metaphor that so good at churning out those antibodies, that we are effectively resistant to the authoritarian impulse. Uh, JMS, I think has made it very clear that he disagrees with that viewpoint.

I mean, Babylon 5 itself is an exploration of how that continually happens. That's deconstruction of falling stars. That's what happens on Minbar.

[01:39:59] **JOSH:** Mm-hmm.

[01:40:00] **JOHN:** I mean, that's major group, every major species in Babylon 5 has to deal with a major G'Kar turning down

[01:40:07] **JOSH:** Mm.

[01:40:08] **JOHN:** dictatorship in fourth season. 

You know, he. 

[01:40:12] **JOSH:** parallel. 

That's another example. 

[01:40:14] **JOHN:** status, Washington view of like, no, you dethroned one dictator only to put on another. And he said, freaking out. You know, that's, that, that was the takeaway. So it's something that, that a sickle happens, and that when they say, oh, you know, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. That doesn't mean a panopticon.

It means watching out for those very totalitarian impulses.

[01:40:33] **JOSH:** That was also really twisted because, uh, security guard number one, has that line in this episode.

[01:40:39] **JOHN:** he use, he uses that line A and it is used in such that, you know, it is almost, Orwellian in that it's reversing what the intent of that very phrase is, is that like, yes, at the gate are always the authoritarians. They're always waiting to scare you into turning over your freedom. and there he is saying the same thing like, oh yeah, you know, the price of freedom is eternal.

They're just like, but you're not offering freedom. You know? Uh, and we'll get to this, the next episode, but it gets really interesting when they say, oh, well, or maybe say episodes later, people on earth are right now, they're kind of satisfied because martial law has cut crime to zero. You know, so there's that honeymoon period, uh, where it goes, yeah, but things are stable.

The stern leader has declared that things are just in order now. And you know what? Life is predictable

for a lot. Trains run on time. Um, that's a huge appeal. That's why these places can last long enough to become real threats to other, states and things like that. But. Yeah, I, security officer, number one, who would've thought that that was, the legacy of that character because I, I certainly don't know his name.

I just know him as that guy who was the Nightwatch guy who was very much a problem for people in, in Season 3. Yeah. I'm looking forward to the next episode. I think that's gonna be a lot of interesting things to discuss, how you, how people can resist how they can't and what luck is involved and where, where loyalty lies as we go careening severed dreams.

yeah, I thought we would've been, still in season two at this point. but the parallels are real. And, uh, the show does pick up this part of the line, and I imagine we'll be jumping through aspects of Season 3 and then season four. Um, season four gets real interesting, especially after the shadow war gets real, real interesting.

Um, a lot of stuff. So, yeah. So in wrapping up, a lot of stuff to process in this episode, we here at Last Best Hope wishing everyone best and, uh, yeah, stay vigilant, look for, the signs of, President Clark and then try to find the better angels. that's what I think Sheridan really offers us, as that counter example, is people who don't want to have to act, but do so only because it's the last choice as it was in this episode. Becoming the reluctant hero.

[01:42:45] **JOSH:** And to remember that sometimes peace is just another word for surrender.

[01:42:49] **JOHN:** Indeed.

[01:42:52] **JOSH:** I thought this was gonna be a short one. I really did. 

[01:42:54] **JOHN:** I thought it was gonna be too.
