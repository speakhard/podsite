## Transcript

[00:00:01] **JOSH:** Back in the halcyon 1990s, a syndicated sci-fi TV series warned us that it indeed can happen here. 

[00:00:08] **JOHN:** In this podcast, we use Babylon 5. We talk through our current political moment in attempt to process, understand, and perhaps find hope. 

[00:00:21] **JOSH:** Yeah, so it's been a while since we've done one of these.

[00:00:24] **JOHN:** It has been, has been.

[00:00:26] **JOSH:** A lot has happened, obviously in the world, but I don't think we've reached our Severed Dreams moment yet. Though I thought we were getting pretty close a few times. Especially, you know, I'm here in Los Angeles and, um, things have calmed down a little. I mean, there's still snatching people up off the streets, which I don't, want to downplay the

horrors of, or the insanity of. Um, but I think like half of the National Guard troops left yesterday. and it seems like the administration did do that thing that where they just sort of declared victory and are kind of moving on, which, um, you know, I think if there's any silver lining to be found in the tactics of this administration or, the fact that much like Trump himself, I don't think that they have a well thought out plan, and I don't think they have the attention span or the stamina to really follow through on something that they start. I feel like if they don't see immediate results they would just as soon move on. 

[00:01:26] **JOHN:** I think that's why it mirrors the psychology of the president because, the lack of interest, the lack of focus, it becomes a big intense moment where there is a brief obsession followed by, as you've said very often, a declaration of victory. And then moving on to the next thing that, grabs, his attention.

I think there's a difference between what's in the minds of the people in his orbit who have very clear agendas with long-term plans and what actually happens when it's filtered through his executive power. So yeah, I think you frame it in an interesting way is, it's, a very strange silver lining, for the rest of us, that there isn't that follow through.

And I actually had a weird moment, a couple months ago when I first heard the taco comment, and I said, don't let him, know that he doesn't follow through. that was about, backing off on, the tariffs and backing off every time.

[00:02:15] **JOSH:** Wait, sorry. What was the taco comment?

[00:02:17] **JOHN:** Yeah. So, Uh, this became a big commentary, and I wanna get the line, right, it refers to the acronym is for TACO, Trump always chickens out.

[00:02:26] **JOSH:** Ah.

[00:02:27] **JOHN:** And it was specifically in regards to the tendency to make tariff threats and then backtrack on them. there is a constant oscillation back and forth.

But what I thought when I heard that, I'm like, well, that's very funny. it is very insightful, but don't let him know, you know, because then at least the damage will be somewhat mitigated as opposed to pointing it out, because that is one thing that happens with him, is that if you point something out, you get his attention that Sauron's eye comes right on you.

So avoid that and sort of, you know, maybe, uh, counteract, elsewhere. I don't, I don't know.But that seems to be a major thing, and I assume it frustrates many of the people in the inner circle, but that's something that, is really interesting. And sometimes, letting that eye pass, and then trying to rebuild can be a good tactic.

But you're right, even with the withdrawal of many of the National Guard troops, the everyday raids are happening. I mean, I saw them in the Northeast I was on vacation, at the very end I saw, ice agents, or what appeared to be ice agents, grabbing people, in a vacation town, Cape Cod, it's, it's absolutely wild.

and that's the part where I think, we're closer in that sense to severed dreams, but the pushback is real and that lack of attention span is real. So it's not like the grand conspiracy that operated around President Santiago's, downfall and President Clark getting in there, followed by the Shadows backing him up, and all these other pieces.

This is an interesting much more, basically political situation with a man who is clearly growing more unstable. The dangers are profound. What really has me thinking now is what happens next with both what he does. If he decides to go, whole hog with some crazy idea, when hoping it goes properly, the end of his term, the next president.

What happens to all these various crazy things that have happened? Does, does The next generation fight for them? Does it, you know,which, which sides within his own party? Take over? those are some interesting questions, and some people think, oh, we gotta survive until they say, oh, I think there's a lot more to be done. Just to make it through three and a half more years. It's three and a half years of this, not only the policies. It's one thing to have, a podcast, you're debating the policies you agree with or disagree with, but it's the massive instability as you said. Like we seem to be going very fast towards cyber dreams veryfast towards that direction.

And then all of a sudden, oh, it's something else. It's whiplash. And it's also just I don't know what to make of it from day to day. there's a weird sense of non-reality that comes from it.

[00:05:01] **JOSH:** Yeah, I mean, to your point, it reminds me of that old, uh, I don't know if saying is the appropriate term here, but like, he's not exactly playing four dimensional chess. Right. it's just lurching from shiny object to shiny object. And when we were talking about what is the end game here? What is the goal, if you think about Trump himself, he kind of has what he wants, right?

[00:05:25] **JOHN:** Yeah. And I guess staying outta jail, staying.Mr. Popular.

[00:05:31] **JOSH:** Yeah. And at this point, that like head fake toward resistance of the establishment from the first go around, eight years ago didn't really happen this time. He hollowed out government agencies and careers, civil servants and everyone who had institutional knowledge of how things were supposed to work and had, some sort of fidelity to the institution and the rule of law itself

[00:05:53] **JOHN:** And 

the funny thing about all that is none of that is Trumpism and none of that is MAGA writ large. That is a combination of Russell Voight, the OMB and the architect of project 2025. And then this amalgamation of that with Elon Musk and whatever concepts he had of efficiency as applied when he took over Twitter and was like, yeah, I'm gonna do that with government.

It's interesting how, that was never on the stump speeches. That was never. Part of, even the very concept of Doge, that was something Musk came up with in the latter part of the campaign. He's just, I mean, for lack of a better term, he's being the useful idiot for people who have these plans.

But I, I genuinely believe this was not, his idea was not to take somebody like RFK, put 'em in charge of HHS and, and, and hollow out our ability to do medical research, which is one of the many things that has happened that was nothing he campaigned on, doesn't have a personal interest in that.

RFK was a useful pawn to get more votes during the election. So now let him run wild there. While Russell Voight and Musk declare we have to hollow out government. You never actually hear Trump talking about the values of that to him, how it will benefit the country.

He just supports it because they supported him. And that's his transactional nature. And that transaction can quickly be reversed if somebody else comes or they betray him or anything like that. But what's really important about that, which I think will, as we, uh,move into the episode is relevant when you talk about governing a country in the long term and the things you have to live with, which is the boring everyday governmental stuff which Trump does not like having to deal with, which has left it open and very vulnerable to people like Russell Voy. And that is, how do you get the things you want in a country, if you imagine medical research is one of the best areas to talk about. how do you get that? How do you get all the amazing innovations and,breakthroughs in medical treatment that you get?

You don't get it by relying on a couple of investors to say, Hey, let's take a long shot on this. The vast majority of medical research comes from government funding filtered through the NIH to research universities on the order of billions upon billions of dollars. And from that, private companies will cherry pick, will develop drugs and medical devices, and carry it the last mile, if you will.

So what it really means is that when people say five years from now, oh, what happened to all these drugs that were in the pipeline? What happened to all the cures or diseases we're looking for. And it's be like, oh, they're not here.

They're gonna be in China and in Europe. And everybody's gonna wonder, well, where did it go? Whose fault was that? Well, it's the groundwork laid now. It doesn't, you don't notice it tomorrow or even next year. And by then, again, not only is Trump's attention span gone, but he won't likely be in any position of influence at that point.

Um, or at least if the institutions hold that long. And that's the real crazy thing about this is that. That's a boring topic to get on a stump speech about you could do one of the wonky podcasts about it. I mean, I listen to 'em every day, but that's not something that's really sexy and is gonna get to the, mainstream headline type grabbing, news and videos.

So what do the rest of us do while we're like, it's like, oh man, he's just hollowing out everything. That's good. You can't even predict the weather. Now, and I know this is totally anecdotal, but I was, you know, when I read about how fewer weather balloons are being set up and how fewer, things and meteorologists in general are saying our predictions on everyday weather are dramatically less accurate than they were one year ago.

Yeah. nothing's been accurate. And I know we always joke about, well, it wasn't, but it's been fairly accurate over recent years. even down to the point where it says it's gonna rain in 15 minutes, that was pretty accurate. You could forecast out four or five days, and there's your rainy day, there's your non rainy day.

Now it's just like, who the hell knows? There's no or reason to it. And that's because not only do we reverse, but you cut out that entirely and it's gone and it doesn't come back by magic.

[00:09:59] **JOSH:** no, because the infrastructure the knowledge and the expertise and the everything of it was, built up over literally decades. you're right, it has a very particular resonance, uh, with the episode that we're about to get into discussing today. 

Private companies have been trying to, get rid of the, uh,

[00:10:20] **JOHN:** The National Weather Service right.

[00:10:21] **JOSH:** yeah because they want to privatize it so they can make money off it, the idea is that if you are the one who controls that information, that really undergirds so much software and so many devices and so many services that people rely on every day. Like you would make a lot, a lot of money. But, the stuff that the National Weather Service and Noah, the stuff they do is not necessarily profitable.

It's like they do risky things, they fly planes into the eyes of hurricanes and stuff like that. just so they can map the storm and provide more information, because. That's the service that they provide. They are serving the public interest and the public good. the shortsighted gutting of that, I suppose, because some people see dollar signs who are in positions to make things go the way they want it to now.

The one-two punch of cutting those organizations and their work off at the knees with the increase in more violent weather events due to climate change is a horrific combination for life on earth. there was that horrible flash flooding that happened in Texas that they had next to no warning about.

And, supposedly, not supposedly, I mean this is true, one of the people at Noah thatthey fired. His job was to coordinate with local media to make sure that the information about the warnings was disseminated to the communities in the ground. I mean, there's no one in that job right now.

[00:11:59] **JOHN:** Wow.

[00:11:59] **JOSH:** So, you know,it seems like this was a very predictable thing if there was just someone who was paying attention and who gave a shit. you know, if this had happened six months ago, a lot of people would probably not have died.

[00:12:13] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[00:12:14] **JOSH:** the maddening thing is that it's a combination between just incompetence and lack of accountability because they don't know what it is that they're actually ruining.

So there's plausible deniability to be like it's not my fault. How was I supposed to know about that?

there are reasons why Before you go in and start slashing jobs and funding, you should maybe educate yourself about how the organization works and what it actually does.

[00:12:40] **JOHN:** what would the rephrase of Longo's line

[00:12:43] **JOSH:** Arrogance and

[00:12:44] **JOHN:** arrogance stupidity. It'd be stupidity and lack of accountability. What an efficient package for messing everything up. that should be the poster of Doge is, you know, it should be. Arrogance stupidity and a lack of accountability because none of 'em will ever be held to account nor do they evendo they hold themselves to account, they don't care.

When you think of those flash floods, the funniest part about that in this very dark sense was the immediate turnaround of the local politicians to say well, who could have ever known? then all the clips to air of the same local politicians during the Biden administration outright refusing the funds to upgrade their emergency response systems because it came with a price from the Biden administration that they had to spend the money on an emergency response system.

They thought that somehow, that was a great offense to them taking money from the federal government, from a Democrat. And it's so childish that it's worst to take money from the other political party to do something that is necessary to save lives. That's where the thinking has gotten.

But you only get that when you have enough leaders promoting that kind of insanity, and that predates, even the Trump era. So that's something that I haven't seen a good counter argument towards, but that's where I think. there's some room to win on issues like that is, is,to really drill home that not only are lives lost, but people are actively stopping the simple things that would save those lives in the future.

And then holding those people, to account. so again, it's a sort of everyday political stuff that most people find so unsexy, so uninteresting. But if you have the right person to focus on it and zero in on it, then there's a little,there's a little bit of hope, there's a little bit of, something for that.

It's funny because that's,that's a good sort of segue into the episode, which when, you're going over the list and I saw the name of that one. I said, wait, is that the Doc Strike episode? Upon rewatching it, I actually think it's one of the best episodes of the first season from a story writing it actually felt, it was not written by JMS.

Very quick note, it was written by Catherine Renan, who at the time I believe, was his wife. and uh, he makes reference to that in the Lurker Guide to say like he did not want to be appearing to be in any nepotistic role, but at some point realizing, you know, she would be great to write an episode and that one of her areas of expertise was to be very politically astute.

This episode felt like a combination of Babylon 5 and the West Wing. It really had a very tight, story, but tight details around the machinations going into this, dock worker strike, in the episode. And to be able to write an episode to where that becomes a compelling narrative, something that you want to watch through, you wanna know what happens.

You want the good guys to win, which are very clearly telegraphed as the dock workers. That's a good political storyteller. Uh, certain political parties could use a bunch of those, when they tell stories about what happens in politics. So that's why this episode is,while it's not as directly related to the arc of how does one slide toward authoritarian on a very obvious scale, when you ask a simple question, how do people end up dissatisfied enough, unhappy enough that they're willing to turn towards anyone with an answer, even the wrong answer. And this episode answers that question because there is no, left or right, political animation of this episode, though, I guess if you associate labor rights with the leftwing, you'll see from that perspective. But they didn't name the Senator, Hidoshi's party. They didn't name who was on what side of what or anything like that.

It was just sort of the everyday real politic of woefully underfunded labor workers who keep everything going on Babylon 5, all the cargo coming on, all the ships coming and going. they, they are the core to the function of that station and the Senate completely ignores them, and, and sees them irrelevant and an inconvenience 

But when you do that long enough, and again, keep in mind, this is the Santiago administration, they refer to Santiago as well. He'll come back to this when he's turned things around. In other words, when he is built up his political capital and can cajole more of the senators to, uh, a better budget for Babylon 5's operations.

Cool. But we hear that every day in our everyday politics here. This is written in 93. It felt like it was written yesterday. And that's every day when that happens day after day, that you're just everyday political parties are up, doing their thing and they're ignoring you as a worker, you as a person, and then they ignore you to the extent that one of your, fellow workers, in this case, one of the brothers dies because of malfunctioning equipment. And overscheduling of work, you're gonna turn to somebody eventually who claims to have an answer. They might be a little more extreme. you know who knows who they will be, but you have to answer that.

And Senator Hidoshi, the senators were not interested in answering the problem of the core of this episode, which is what happens in your everyday operations of Babylon 5, when you over schedule your dock workers, when you, underinvest in how many of 'em you have, and you underinvest on the contracts, the microchips that blew out causing the accident in the docking bay.

All that is, again, it's not a sexy issue on its face, but when you tell the right story around it, it can really get you interested. And there was a lot to, uh,sink your teeth into, with this episode.

[00:18:21] **JOSH:** Yeah, you know, there's a lot of stuff in here that if I'm being completely honest, when I was a kid, I didn't have a lot of time for this episode. For I think, reasons that are self-explanatory. Now I think you're right. I think this is one of the highlights of the first season for me.

And it's just striking that.

[00:18:40] **JOHN:** Ah, you said it.

[00:18:41] **JOSH:** Pun completely unintended, but appropriate as the best ones are. you know, this is not a story Star Trek would ever do. you know what, I actually take that back. 

[00:18:50] **JOHN:** Deep Space Nine did an episode on unionization of Quarks. And when they went back in time with the riots in 2023,

[00:18:59] **JOSH:** No, you're right. I take it 

[00:19:00] **JOHN:** Bell riots your point is valid, that no other Star Trek did except Deep Space Nine, which is the other Star Trek. It's about what happens outside of the post scarcity, infinite resource Federation when you're on the edge of that, when you don't have the convenience, of your near utopian society to back you up the same way.

[00:19:22] **JOSH:** Yeah. there's also The Cloud Minders in season three of the original series. 

But anyway, the point is Star Trek, particularly at this moment in the early nineties, it was not really that interested in, the nitty gritty details of how the Star Trek universe operated on a day-to-day sense. And you know, it was interesting you mentioned, uh, this, political mindset about, how politics has sort of devolved into very tribal and, zero sum us versus them, mentality that is like substance list.You know, It's not about the pros and cons of policy. It's about you're for it, therefore I'm against

[00:20:00] **JOHN:** Mm-hmm. 

[00:20:01] **JOSH:** And even more than that, your authority is not even legitimate.

Yeah. And I think the context in which this episode was written is the beginning of this modern version of

I was gonna say politics, but I think it's a little more pathological than that. You know, In this episode they talk about invoking the Rush Act, which was named after Rush Limbaugh,

Yes. Yes.Who at this moment combined with Newt Gingrich, who shortly after this episode aired, would become the leader of the House of Representatives, uh, In the 1994 midterms and the uh, Republican Revolution as they called it.

And the two of them, more than anyone else, I think, really ushered in this, um.Zero sum idea of politics and that it's not about policy, it's about dehumanizing the opposition and it's about winning, might say through any means necessary. 

[00:20:58] **JOHN:** You know what JMS, on the lookers guide, that summarizes all the emails and all the things that he posted on AOL back in the day and says, who is Rush Limbaugh? Somebody asks, and JMS's response was leading American proctologist, trust me.

[00:21:11] **JOSH:** yeah.

[00:21:11] **JOHN:** And it was funny to have that opinion and I,I'm trying to go back in my mind, and, that was itself an inflection point for our history was the coming of this Republican revolution that was, revolting against something that no one could really put their finger on.

It wasn't a particular policy. What it managed to do was get people really angry at the other side, especially if you're listening to AM Radio and Rush Limbaugh every day, as you said, just, just for being on the other side. So whatever they did, it must be the wrong thing.

Even if it is a boring policy thing of like, where do we put the next weather station? And somehow that becomes the next political firepoint. Rather than just being like, well you do, you do that because you do that because then we can predict the weather. it began to get lost to us and there was a great cycle repeating of that when you see that two years after the next Democrat president, when Barack Obama, you have the Tea Party non coincidentally coming up in the midterm elections 2010, and it's the same exact vibe.

They're rebelling against this thing, they can't stand Obamacare. But then when interviewed on television, five years later, all the people are saying, well, we gotta get rid of Obamacare, but don't you dare take my Affordable Care Act. And you're like, 

what?

[00:22:22] **JOSH:** well, yeah, I mean that's even happening now. the slashing of Medicaid. There are people who are for that, but don't understand that what Medicaid is called in their state. You know, Usually they have some sort of state specific name for their

[00:22:41] **JOHN:** Yes, yes.

[00:22:41] **JOSH:** they don't realize that the healthcare that they get from their state is actually Medicaid money. And you know, that confusion is intentional and it's fostered. the people who support this really think that Medicaid and the federal spending on these programs is, some other thing that is just for like black people.

Yeah. Yeah. Their understanding of how government works and what it does and who it works for is completely warped.

[00:23:12] **JOHN:** By design, as you said, like they

[00:23:14] **JOSH:** No, completely

[00:23:15] **JOHN:** Is done to foster that. And it's by design, as you said, is to say this program benefits this other group that isn't in your tribe. They'll do it along race lines, along cultural lines, along religious lines. Uh, and, And it's very interesting which without going too much into the weeds on that, it's why the strongest enduring programs when you think of those like Medicare and social security are because they apply to everybody, or specifically those two apply to everybody who was essentially ever worked no matter how much or how much money they made.

And it becomes universal buy-in. And it's much harder to chip away at that on a tribal line. Whereas other more means tested programs, you say well, they only apply to this group or this group, or this income strata. It's easier to divide people. And those divisions are sort of what people are relying on.

And that's why the politics in this episode, and again, this is a political episode in the lowercase p sense, it's, yeah I compare it to West Wing because it's very much it feels like it's a wonky episode in that sense too. These are. You are every day workers on Babylon 5, but they are the laborer class.

It's the way that they are dressed, the way that they talk. They are largely portrayed by Latino actors in the episode. The names that are chosen. my, that's very much by design. It was meant to equate that to the nineties sense of yes, who are uh, your typical conception of laborers.

and even now, we're now, you know, 30 years past that. And it's the same. We very often, equate laborers with not only the economic strata, but certain ethnic, links and everything else. And that can be used to dehumanize, that can be used to, make that group the other, say, well, why do they think they're entitled to so much?

why do they get all of this? Completely ignoring the, obviously very well-funded, contractors who are making all the money installing cheap microchips on Babylon 5. that's a story ripped out of today's world as much as it was 30 years ago or almost any other time. the way, the way Garibaldi references the lowest bidder government contractor putting in cheap microchips.

The language used, the phrasing, sounded like somebody just said it to me yesterday. and you could be talking about that, in so many ways, in so many modern. Issues we've seen that type of thing play out. And it made me think, oh wow, this is something that just keeps on going. This debate keeps on happening.

So when we were talking about doing this episode, I'd mentioned the things that sort of pinged in my mind was we're back having the air traffic controller debate today. they just announced, well, they increased funding for air traffic control one of the few things that actually got an increase in budget, that wasn't border or military related yet, all the money is going to modernize, the system, which this episode talks about, like the dockers are in part gonna strike because they're overworked, overscheduled, understaffed, but also they're working with substandard, outdated, breaking down equipment.

So you say at least they're addressing one of those things. But you look at what's happening today, the air traffic controls themselves say our system actually works. It needs improvement. we see, you know this, but the problem is the same as it has been for many decades, understaffing, dramatic understaffing.

So here you think well, this episode has a real parallel to that, and all you have to do is go back to Lurker's Guide again. And you see what was in the mindset of the writers in this case Kathryn Drennan and then JMS, as the showrunner, and he references. The air traffic strike of the early 1980s at the very beginning of the Ronald Reagan administration.

And that was a famous historical incident where the air traffic controllers under incredibly difficult work circumstances decided to strike. And it is against current federal law for not only federal auto traffic controllers, but many other sectors that are involved with transportation to strike.

And what Reagan did was in one fell swoop, he fired the 11,000 striking air traffic controllers. Now he then quickly had the government hire some of them back But to this day, they never got up to the staffing levels that they even needed back in the early 1980s.

They've always been way below staffing. So the current complaints today, and we're watching in our world, what's happening at Newark Airport, near collisions, shutdowns, all kinds of stuff. And they say, well, it's just the equipment woefully understaffed. No one wants to work at Newark Airport.

No joke, just in Newark and New Jersey. But it's a high traffic area where the cost of living is extremely high. So they're not paying enough for the air traffic controllers to live there, and there aren't enough of them. I'm like, we watched this story in 1981 and now we watched the story on Babylon 5.

The solution seems pretty simple. Allocate a bit more funds. It's nothing when you do the actual math, it's a tiny fraction of a fraction of the budget. I always ask myself, even as a kid, and now as an adult why did they just allocate that little bit amount of money and hire more people and habits that people work reasonable shifts?

Isn't that a simple solution? And in this episode, the answer is the same as it's always been. The Senate first doesn't care. And then underlying that, when they get the the negotiator as he is in there, what was his name? Um, Zeto.

[00:28:32] **JOSH:** or in Z. That's a great name.

[00:28:34] **JOHN:** Not only Does he not have an intention of negotiating?

You can tell with his sort of smarm this, he has an act of contempt.

[00:28:41] **JOSH:** disdain for these people. 

[00:28:42] **JOHN:** Who are they to ask more of us. I mean, he's like this feudal lord coming down from on high saying, how dare you demand enough food to eat? Isn't there enough purpose in your life just working as my surf? That's, and that's who these people are today.

Whether they're senators, the negotiators, the businessmen as human beings, they don't see these workers as human. they, They see them as cogs that they are entitled to use for their own economic purposes. And in this episode, they use the language you signed a contract. You signed a contract and that contract said you can't strike and you can't, you know what they added in, which I caught really quickly was you can't quit.

I'm not aware of maybe, and maybe someone can comment on this episode, I'm not aware of many contracts, certainly not in the private sector, but I'm not aware of any in the government sector that restricts somebody from quitting. I know that if you've engaged in military service there ob there, there are some restrictions.

You, you can't simply quit the inventory. And I wonder if those same caveats exist with government contractors, that the employees of a government contractor can't quit 

under certain conditions. That's wild.

[00:29:51] **JOSH:** It would make sense if you think about where they are. here living on earth you quit a job, likeyou walk outside and go wherever you want.

Like when you're on a space station, an enclosed environment where the very air that you're breathing is manufactured and paid for by somebody and there's not really anywhere you can go. very presence there is costing somebody money.

[00:30:15] **JOHN:** Yeah, the comparison for that would be in modern day oil rigs out at sea. And definitely the past is full of that with the indentured servants who were under the employee of the various entities, of the, you know, colonial era when you're sending people out on ships that took six months to get across as sea or whatever, whatever that was,you couldn't just quit

under that circumstance

you were under the lash. So even if you decided, Hey, I don't want any more money, I think this situation that was misrepresented to me. This is an abusive situation. I'm getting out. You had nowhere to go. You're on a ship and when you ended up on another continent, you also had nowhere to go except maybe out into the wilderness.

So this situation is one that we have these historical analogs for of being isolated. And it's a really tough one. You were under the complete control of other people, and there's a lot of talk, freedom Liberty is American ideals. These were, these are people who were effectively indentured.

But we like to think that indentured servitude is something of the past. You'd like to think that slavery is something of the past, but there's so many circumstances like this where you are. This close to that without realizing it. Yes. In our modern world, unlike the dock workers here, in most cases, you can quit.

Today. Again, the flight controllers, to my knowledge, are not bound in contract to never quit. Most of 'em are there because they love it. They're training has geared them for that career. So it would be an economic risk for them to quit and go into another a sector. So there's an incentive not to, but when you take away that ability to strike you've fundamentally altered the balance of power.

You've taken that power away and you've said well, sure, go quit. Where are you gonna go? 

[00:31:57] **JOSH:** Right.

[00:31:58] **JOHN:** and where would you send thousands, say, 11,000 drug controllers? It is probably more than that today. Where do they get sent today? Where are they gonna go in their lives? How are they gonna pay their mortgages and all that other stuff?

So that power is extraordinary that whoever's writing the checks has. And in this case, in this episode, the checks are not coming from a businessman. That's, That's where people sort of get caught up in, oh, it's their money. Well, it is the Senate's 

money. 

They're deciding where it goes. And they made promises that were alluded to in the episode about the previous negotiator.

Oh, no. Paper trail of that. Sorry. It didn't really happen. The, well, you gotta wait for the president to consolidate his power so he can honor those requests. But what do you do about the people dying today? All these things. They're written for today's audience, and they broke and they started striking and seeing that unfold, seeing their own union head initially be like, no, no, no, no.

Word strike. We can't do that. And then when they are completely rejected by the negotiator and told, keep your heads down. Do the work, you're fine. The gas, you would gaslight them. All the experts say, you have enough equipment and you have enough people to schedule this for. I know that that's just what they're told.

But tell that to an air traffic controller today. In fact, I know personally, other people in auxiliary industries associated with the airlines, all overscheduled, all in unions that can't do very much because they're all prevented legally from striking. it's sort of interesting to think about the power, a group of people who are striking it's terrifying to those in charge.

It's terrifying to those that rely on the system. But I can tell you, it's not the end of the world. I traveled to London, there was a metro strike that's illegal in the United States. The New York City, MTA, they cannot strike. They're not allowed to strike. France and Paris, they're always striking in the metro for a better deal.

They're still functional cities. That's the interesting part. You know, I was thinking to myself, oh, I regret that thought too. my God, they chose now to strike when I'm visiting as if they knew. I was gonna dane the city of London with my presence. As extraordinary as it is, I literally made it about me because that's what you do, especially as a traveler.

you think the whole world is about you. And I thought, how inconvenient? And then I look back, I'm like, well, that's a shitty thing for me to have thought. And no, it was a week long strike. It impacted me for one day. And you know what? It got them a better deal. It got them better work conditions, which is a big thing.

I mean, imagine being told, nope, you don't get 10 hour turnaround. That's in the episode. That's one of the points they bring up.That's what she was writing in this episode, that level of detail based on strikes that actually are happening. They wanted a 10 hour turnaround, which meant that from the point you stop working on the docks, you get 10 hours before you're back on the docks.

Now, our lives back comparison are pretty cushy because I can't imagine a life, and work that's saying you only get 10 hours between when you leave work and you start work again. that's 10 hours to sleep, to eat, to bathe, to do whatever you need to do in your life. And then you're right back at the docks managing Babylon 5.

Like that's wild. And all they were asking for was 10 hours. That means they were getting less, they were getting less than 10 hours. who thinks that's okay.

[00:35:12] **JOSH:** Yeah. I mean, if you don't think of the people who do that work as deserving of that sort of consideration which unfortunately I think it's all that it boils down to which, there were a bunch of really great quotes in this episode. One of them was one thing hasn't changed, workers are always getting shafted.

which was actually in response to, Sinclair had this line twice. and it made me think of it, when you said that, this episode really isn't, tied into the, um,main story about earth, about the,slide into fascism. Um, Sinclair says things are changing on earth and not all for the better.

[00:35:50] **JOHN:** Hmm. A very subtle line that you wouldn't pick up.

[00:35:53] **JOSH:** No. because it just sounds like the kind of thing that people think and say, no matter what's going on, like there's always that sense that things are changing and not for the better, but that's what he is talking about. And so this mentality that the government is entitled to the labor of certain people and doesn't have to fully account for their humanity or for their, welfare, let alone their, desires and dreams.

I don't know. I mean, maybe this is the lefty in me, but. I can't help but see, uh,an implicit relationship between that sort of attitude separating people into one group that's deserving and one group that's not. And, dehumanizing whole, swaths of people because, you know, you don't think that they're, deserving of same kind of consideration.

and, material, expenditure as you are,

[00:36:47] **JOHN:** not worthy of dignityof a simple dignity and respect. And this is something that is really troublesome because we all experience it, whether we want to admit it or not. Which is when you interact with somebody, particularly in hospitality, the service industry, delivery people, it's really hard not to default to the mindset that they're there to serve you.

And that as a result, they're beneath you. so when you're having a bad day and you grumble, uh, and you treat that Starbucks barista awfully, it starts to be justified by, well, they're just a barista, right? If they were somebody of value, they'd be doing something else. which is a wild mindset that, again, I found myself having those same thoughts.

When you're in that moment, I think the question is, do you then step back and say, wait a second, what did I just ask? And you start saying, they're doing a job. Wait, I wanted that coffee. I wanted to go in here and get that. This is something that actually has value to me. Why am I, dehumanizing, but also just decreasing the value of that person?

Why? because they're not doing some other job. And then what, what are the majority of the jobs and. It's a system that I think we're all sort of indoctrinated to, which is to say, well, wherever we are at any given time, and that shifts your place in the pecking water is a lot less solid than most people realize.

We're taught that, oh, just look down on anybody who's below you. Keep on looking down at them and as a result, don't look up out of envy and then everything will stay ordered. and that is how labor's kept down. that's how slavery was maintained, uh, before the Civil War.

It was, well, at least you aren't in that group of people. You're above them. Even if you're sort of at the bottom, you're above them. And breaking out of that indoctrinated mentality is the real difficulty what Babylon 5 does in interesting ways. It says here we are 200 years from now, we haven't broken free of that.

There's a huge system of different cast, as you will with the Earth Alliance sell. The men borrow themselves are more advancedand they have an actual caste system, with one of the groups being workers who are, woefully overutilized and under respected until Delaine recreates the gray Councilto be worker dominant, recognizing this very truth.

Babylon 5 is not meant to,portray a worker paradise meantto say like, Hey, even on Babylon 5 with our vaunted heroes, there's this underclass that keeps everything going. And this episode brings that to light. It does play out through the rest of the series. I think you do. See, that's why you have the lurkers.

That's why you have down below. They never shy away from this being real, but nor do they say it's a good thing that it's there. It's there because we haven't figured out how to make it better yet. And I don't think that what JMS wanted out of Babylon 5 was the, it's better because it's the future.

It's better because we have more technology. I think that's the really interesting about Babylon 5 is that it tells us a hard truth, which is that just having more technology and just having more time between you and the past doesn't mean you're gonna get rid of those really difficult, negative and very dark aspects of your society.

And how has that dealt with this episode shows Sinclair as the hero, ultimately and as the ultimate negotiator, if you'll, he's the ultimate diplomat both in the a, a storyline and the b storyline with Kar Ando, which is a very fun, funny storyline. But he does something that is very much what a protagonist hero character would do.

He comes in, he thinks about the situation, from multiple angles, trying to find out. How to do the morally right thing while also doing the thing that he can do. And those two things don't always overlap, and that's the dilemma of the episode, is initially he has to send in, Garibaldi with his forces to break the strike under order, That's literally his job as the military governor of Babylon v. What he's plotted out in a really cool way is that he does what Sheridan does in season three in the lead up to severed dreams. He says, how can I use the language of the law like a lawyer, to subvert, what these other actors are doing, like the negotiator the Senate.

And he realizes that once the Rush Act is enacted,

[00:41:09] **JOSH:** If he can do whatever he wants.

[00:41:10] **JOHN:** he has the authority under statute to end the conflict by whatever means necessary. Now, we all know what the writers that law as Fictionally portrayed would've imagined. That meant the iron fist of force.

Sinclair sees it differently and that's why he is our hero, because he sees not only a better solution, one that works, but one that also fulfills the moral equation of saying, yes, we are going to, make the lives of the dock workers better.

we're gonna hire more. We're going to upgrade the equipment, we're gonna reduce their shifts. So he wins in that sense. And the episode is brilliant because then it turns and Senator Heri contacts him, and this whole time you think Hadi's just sort of disconnected and just, you know, and he gives him some advice.

He says, listen, my grandfather was a dock worker every day of his life. I have great sympathy for this, but this is politics. And that reality is you just embarrassed somebody very publicly who has powerful friends and they don't like being embarrassed by proxy. So you have new enemies and it basically says you did the right thing in the inconvenient way, which is what the president says.

The Sheridan, when he frees Earth, is all about politics. And Babylon 5 is about politics. It's about how do you navigate a system? people think politics is about the tribes you're in. Politics is really about how you navigate a system, and maybe you're using the tribes to your advantage, but it's about how do you use these?

Mechanations and Jams really wrote a lot of cool stuff in all five seasons as to how these mechanics work and how our protagonists really manipulate them. So we have the happy ending. We have the dock worker strike ending. We have them also getting a benefit. and you have the ominous, foreboding warning to Sinclair.

But the cool thing about a TV show, unlike real life, is we know. That when all is said and done, even in Babylon 5, our protagonists, our heroes, generally speaking, make it out all right. The real world isn't quite like that. So somebody who in our world who made a decision like Sinclair, would likely be out very quickly.

[00:43:14] **JOSH:** Yeah. Sinclair had a great line. He says you should never hand someone a gun unless you're sure where they'll 

[00:43:18] **JOHN:** Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

[00:43:20] **JOSH:** Great line. I also wanna mention you mentioned Senator Hadi. I was looking him up, the actor who played him I'm gonna mispronounce his name, but AKI along.

he just recently passed away on June 22nd.

[00:43:32] **JOHN:** Oh, wow.

[00:43:33] **JOSH:** and I was also looking up the director of this episode, Jim Johnston, who, he actually appears in the episode as one of the dock workers. He has a line, he says, I say We strike, he just passed away in 2023. So that reminded me, you know, this show, I still think of it as more or less having aired yesterday, but, Babylon 5 curse aside, we are losing a lot of these people who actually made it.

So it is slipping into history and it is just a testament to the show that, again, setting aside the, maybe nineties aesthetics of it, how, contemporary and how relevant and of this moment feels in that sense. It's,really timeless.

So, yeah, for. Various reasons. It's very easy to forget how long ago this show was actually made. Um, I have a question for you, and it is sort of opening a can of worms that,

[00:44:28] **JOHN:** Oh, I love that.

[00:44:29] **JOSH:** that possibly undercuts the very premise of the show itself. why isn't all of this like robots? Like why are there still humans doing all of this manual labor and performing all of these jobs?

Obviously the main answer is to tell an interesting story about humans. But, given everything we were just talking about the devaluing of human life trying to cut corners, not wanting to have to pay.

Is it simply that it's cheaper to employ human beings than spend a lot of money on a highly advanced system that you have to maintain? I mean, like, in some sense, are humans more disposable than machines? Maybe. I don't know.

[00:45:11] **JOHN:** That's, That's a really good question. That, that, that's,it's a hell of a can of worms. I think going to the very beginning, the reason why this story is told you nailed it, is because these stories are told to be accessible, for the time they're told in. for a while I thought, well, it's just that our writers are not imagining, that much into the future.

I don't think there's any lack of creativity from JMS or any of our great sci-fi writers. it's that if you actually do the sort of envisioning of what it would require to do space travel based on our current understanding of technology and trying to project it out, none of it looks like Star Trek.

None of it looks like, Babylon 5 because that's based on a very 20th century view of naval fleet ships combined with NASA going out into space with a 20th century mindset. But that's when the stories were told. the technology is so far beyond what we would be doing. You know, some people theor as generation ships or everything else.I don't know what kind of stories you would tell except the story about what that might be like. And there is some really cool sci-fi about that. I recommend to people for something that's accessible about what interacting with the aliens is like and how fast technology goes, three Body Problem is interesting example of that, with a fairly good Netflix series, to it, at least I enjoyed it, but what I liked was the portray of what it's like just having 400 years between you and another species and how that's huge gulf, but also makes what they are incomparable to the stories we're telling now a few ships and stations and things like that.

I do think that you bring up a really interesting point about labor. why would they be using dock workers instead of completely automated and say, well, if Amazon is automating more of their warehouses? Well, They are, but they're increasing capacity while still using an equal amount of not still expanding amount of humans.

Theoretically there are gonna be technologies, I think, down the road that can replace a ton of human labor. I think we're gonna see that actually quicker in white collar work than we're gonna see it in blue collar work, in the next few years. And that's gonna be hugely unsettling to our economy and society since we don't know how to adapt to it from a political standpoint. But I think an interesting answer to it would be. Human beings don't know how to exist without labor. We don't know how to value each other or what we do in a society without there being some aspect of labor involved. I'd like to think that we can advance beyond that. Star Trek never answered the questions to how that actually looks.

Though I think it comes closest to the idea, and that's comparing without going too much into another show on it. But going to that sort of Gene Roddenberry, motion picture idea is that well, the people who need to do and also see others doing effectively end up in Starfleet, they end up on exploratory ships,

they end up out there. The others are living a variety of lives on earth, whether they are artists, creatives, different kinds of explorers, or doing nothing or as the novelization of the motion picture refers to the copious amount of orgies apparently, that Roddenberry wrote about. Not that he was projecting in any way there.

It's really, that's the closest I can imagine. It's like, yeah, we don't know what we would do with ourselves. We'd have to find these other outlets, which is why I actually think we're gonna constantly invent new systems to keep us working, even if the work is literally pointless. Well, a robot can do that.

Yeah. But if, listen, if we have robots doing everything. I don't know how to value the people around me or control them, which is another part of society. How do you control people and order them? Uh, I really do think that as a related side note, there was a sociologist, economist I'll try to get his name up in a minute.

He wrote a book before he sadly died, an early age in the year 2020, called bullshit jobs. And it describes that particularly in white collar, which is the majority now of US jobs, that it's bullshit. And he outlines the different categories of why not only are these jobs terribly redundant, pushing paper to somebody else who pushes paper or an email to somebody else.

And a lot of people can probably relate who are listening to this. The amount of meetings you end up in a given day that are meetings about other meetings that discuss having another meeting. And then maybe you get to do actual work one hour a day before you have to go back into another meeting.

And you're like what am I doing? And he analyzes pretty convincingly that most of the work that's done is bullshit. it actually makes more work for other people to do, but that's the design of the system. Otherwise, we don't know how to interact with each other. We don't know how to estimate why somebody has the resources they have.

We don't know how to, figure out their value as a person and how we would interact with them. It's not where I think we wanna be, but I don't think we yet know another way of.Of ordering our society. So yeah, I think having a laborers 200 year in the future, they're working with,with very sophisticated mechanical equipment on the station, obviously, and they refer to the computers.

I did think that the way they were talking about computers when you remember this is 1993, that the episodes written in 94, it is actually still somewhat accurate in modern feeling, the way they were talking about how computers were used. So not only would there be a role for labor, I don't know that we know how to live without labor.

and I don't know that we know how to deal with the idea of people who aren't, in those high-end scientific or creative jobs. They're like, well, people have to work. People have to be doing something. And what will it be, will be digging a ditch to fill in another ditch, which is, you know, sort of what you had during the WPA.

I think that's what a lot of it is. And I'd love for somebody to show me what some of the ideas are of how to have a, post scarcity economy that doesn't rely on this concept of, either bullshit jobs and white collar or just make work physical jobs, in the physical sector.

B5 is not giving us that deliberately. It's saying no, we're still stuck in this sort of paradigm of the 20th century all the way out 200 years later. And it doesn't seem like there's any attempt to get past it either. from the standpoint of Earth. What did you think? I always had a sense that likethe shadows, the Vorlons and something else that clearly had a whole different way of doing things.

They refer to there being very few actual Vorlons. It sounds like they're just constantly interacting with this copious amount of organic technology. You think of Draal and the great machine, like one dude in the middle of this giant machine managing everything. But then again, no, there's my point. You have Zathras doing all the manual labor, all the different Zathrases. 

you're just like, oh, so you still have the manual labor and how underappreciated is poor Zathras there?

You have Draal there. There's your like classic 20th century economic thing. He looks down upon Zathras, though he does have a fondness for him and there's poor Zathras having like clean shit up all the time. Literally. It's like that's, is that what we're stuck in?

[00:51:51] **JOSH:** Yeah. There are a lot of things at play here. I mean, first of all, I think simply a big part of it is when you're a writer and you're telling stories, you want tell stories that are relevant to the audience that you imagine you're writing for. So there's that there's also a certain amount of, it's like, when you start to pull at those threads, the story becomes about that 

[00:52:13] **JOHN:** yes. 

[00:52:14] **JOSH:** because it's so much of a massive shift that you have to explain everything.

[00:52:20] **JOHN:** And then it's oh well, if, that no longer works like that, then that would no longer work like this. And so, so you can't really tell the story you want to tell, you're totally right. And that's what,there's so much great speculative fiction out there and science fiction that does deal with things like that. But you're right, the focus is largely on describing how that world works and how people interface with that world. Um, and it becomes hard to make it about the people themselves.

I think that's why fantasy environments are also so appealing as audiences, because again, you could tell a modern story, reframe it in a fantasy land that's, maybe has medieval level technology or the fantasy setting where you can make it whatever you want. 

And there's your story, there's your relatableness.

It's not meant to be historically accurate, obviously, but you're telling that story. But yeah, it can get caught up. I will say, I'd love to follow up on this in a future episode or another podcast even. I started a series because of politics. I read an article that said that all of the tech lords out there right now, you know, Zuckerberg to, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk their favorite book is about the culture, these sci-fi series that starts with, consider feis.

I'd never read it. So I started reading them recently and I'm enjoying it quite substantially. But they're all obsessed with the really well done, intricate descriptions of technology in those books. And they ignore it's a complete reordering of society as well.

And omnisexual space hippies with ais are essentially the main protagonists and the victors throughout the books. And it is a complete reframing of that and who the antagonists and all the difficulties they face are.

But what's fascinating is The people who are reading that at the top of our economy right now are missing everything except for the really cool descriptions of technology. They're ignoring the description of how society might be ordered to account for those technologies like advanced ais.

B5 does not go down that road too much of advanced ai, uh, even the shadow ships require human CPUs as a component. There really isn't much super computing going on.

[00:54:25] **JOSH:** Which is interesting. I mean, first of all, you see that a lot with our current, techno over lords. The um, Sam Altman deliberately drawing comparisons between his product and the movie her.

[00:54:39] **JOHN:** And it's like you understand that her was like a cautionary tale, right? Like it wasn't supposed to be like a how to manual. yeah.

[00:54:48] **JOSH:** no. there's some, meme that's been floating around that I'm absolutely, I'm going to slaughter but it's like uh, nevermind. I can't even come up with an approximation. 

[00:54:57] **JOHN:** You can edit that in after the show.

[00:54:58] **JOSH:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. a lot of these, technologies were from, science fiction stories where whole point of the story was how that technology was either being misused or was dangerous and shouldn't exist like that.

And it seems like a lot these guys, we're so distracted, by the bright shiny objects or they're sociopathic and that's only thing they can see. And yeah, so,we have human beings, creating dystopian science fiction that we all grew up with.

That was supposed to be a warning about how you shouldn't do that.

[00:55:33] **JOHN:** EEvery 

time. and we ask ourselves like, did they not read the book reading this article about Mark Zuckerberg bringing this book to his book club? and then. All the other major Silicon Valley figures having read this book series. The author I believe is is Ian Banks a Scottish author if I call, and that they can so woefully misconstrue something.

it boggles mind, but it makes a certain sense that, there just literally obsessed with the coolness factor. And I think of myself as that. When I was a kid watching Star Trek and then Babylon 5, what were the moments that I most wanted to go back on my VHS tapes and play? It was the cool battles.

Now, Babylon 5 has a unique position with that because it managed to marry an episode with amongst the best space battle in history with one of the most dramatically well-written stories ever. And that's Severed Dreams. I know we'll do that episode at some point. I almost hope we don't ever have to do that episode, know,

we'll keep dangling that one. So when you go back to that, you get the full spectrum of amazing experience. But really at most points you're like, I wanna see the space bed, I wanna see the lasers, I wanna see the ship slam into each other. And I did that with Star Trek.

I'm like, I wanna see the cool special effects when they used them. And I think these guys are locked into that part of their brains who, when they were 14 years old and they just wanna do the cool things. There's some CEOs who are like, you know, we're gonna create. Murder drones, it's gonna be great.

And you're like, didn't we like have a whole movie ongoing franchise called Terminator about that? And how you don't want, they're like, yeah, it'll be created by, and it'll be controlled by a central ai. It's like, wait, we call that Skynet. don't you think like there's some warning signs about that?

No, it's gonna be the coolest thing ever. And you think oh, they weren't, watching the same thing. And there's also just a simple explanation of there's arrogance. Oh, it won't happen when I do it. And how many times have we all done that in our lives? Well, It won't happen when I do it.

And then of course, lo and behold, it happens. That's the thing that I can imagine, frustrates the writers of books and shows like this. Um, I think JMS had to transcend that at some point, because I just recall that, you know, for a while he took a bit of a step back from the online communities because every day, back in the nineties would be him explaining something to somebody and then to, with created this show, have people in modern day look at it and be like, oh, there's no comparison to what's happening in Babylon 5 to what's happening in the modern era.

Be like, no, it was designed for that purpose. It was written that the critiques about historical figures are well-documented by the writer in those references. What are you talking about? How frustrating it must be to be JMS and deal with that. And I think perspective was required for him to pull back and say, okay I can't engage with everybody who's just completely obtuse.

[00:58:12] **JOSH:** And it also must give you a very enlightening, let's say, perspective on how information travels and how knowledge travels and how things are misunderstood and

misconstrued. Like, He's in a situation which is sort of like, society's information ecosystem writ small. It's just him, he's God.

And then he has like a handful of fans and acolytes and some haters who were following him around in these online spaces. And like he can say something. And then, people are arguing with him about the show he made and the thing he said, and it's like, I don't know how else I can explain this to you.

No, that's not

[00:58:48] **JOHN:** And it's not like, when you're in class and your teacher is, telling you what some artist who died hundreds of years ago 

meant through their piece of art or through their novel

[00:58:58] **JOSH:** like he's sitting right there telling you exactly what he

meant. 

[00:59:00] **JOHN:** there. and the great writers will always say, oh, well this operates on many levels, just like a good song.

You take from it what you will. But then there is that idea would say I said that punching somebody in, and doing this is a bad thing and you're saying it's a good thing. No, I said it was a bad thing and I said it right here, and I'm saying it now. And people will still say, no, you didn't.

That's not what that means. How maddening is that experience. And I guess at some point you just, you either laugh at it and detach, but also, I wonder how cynical, it makes you, I know that in the case of Alan Moore, I think it made him more detached. that's the author of, Watchman Graphic novel.

And when people would come up to you on the street and say, oh man, that hero Rorschach, he's like, my inspiration. Alan more famous would,would respond, get away from me. Do not come near me. You're a horrible person. You completely misinterpreted my work. And I'm telling you that he was not the hero of that book and that he was reprehensible character.

And still legions of fans are like, what? No, that's, that's the person I relate to. He's the cool hero of it. So it's, at some point the art goes out there. It's beyond your control. you do have to let go of that. But I think in the case when you're still around, you can still comment on it.

You can at least. Reach the people you can reach and be like, Hey, this,is at least what I was mean to communicate. Lemme give you some context, lemme give you some insight into the writer's process. That's something I really appreciate about JMS is he, he not only shares what his intent was, he shares the process, how he crafted it, which is really insightful.

That's something that we don't always get from writers.

[01:00:31] **JOSH:** No, and especially at the time that he did it and in the venue that he chose it was really pioneering. It was really unprecedented. There had been nothing like it before. he did it, he thought it was important to do it, and it was also very intentional.

Whereas, you know, you have some similar things in recent years of, you know, live commentaries on social media. You can ask creators questions. You have podcasts and all of these interviews and commentaries on things. But that's mostly because of the technology and the information ecosystem and media ecosystem that we live in now.

I mean, not to, diminish the, uh, generosity that a lot of these creators have to share their insights and use their time to do so. But like with JMS doing this in the very early nineties, to very intentionally say, I am going to lift the curtain on the process of creating writing, show running, producing a television series because it's a very opaque process and I have an opportunity to, create a,record in real time of how it's actually done.

Um,so much of why I do what I do and why I'm interested in what I'm interested in is because of reading the JMS Speaks section on the lurker guide. hearing him explain things and talk about how things were done and how things worked and just, you know, realizing that it was a real thing that I could wrap my head around.

It wasn't some magical thing that happened somewhere else that you likehad to, be sort of anointed. As someone who's allowed to know how these magical systems work, no, it's a thing, it's a job and here's how it works. It's imperfect and sometimes we make mistakes and here's how you try to learn from them.

Here's how you try to avoid them. And uh, yeah, it's really quite amazing that he did that. By the way, before I forget, the, uh,thing I was referencing earlier was actually a tweet from 2021 by, at Alex Blackman who, um,is a writer, game designer and staff writer for the Onion and Click Hole.

He had a tweet sci-fi author in my book I invented the Nexus as a cautionary tale, and then a tech company. At Long Last, we have created the Torment Nexus from the classic sci-fi novel. Don't Create the Torment Nexus. It's like sort of the,the summation of what you were talking about.

[01:02:45] **JOHN:** It absolutely is. But the moment I hear that, my mind was able to create the entire stupid press conference that some random generic tech company was doing about that and the enthusiasm and Tech pro speak that would be around it. Like a Ted Talk almost. And I'm thinking, yeah. I don't know, maybe we sort of deserve it.

When somebody decides to invent the Grey Goo, the nan, everything's look what we just did. It's really? That's what you were thinking about doing?

[01:03:12] **JOSH:** Yeah. There's some interview with Sam Altman from a few years ago I keep returning to in my head over and over again. I can't, it's my eternal torment, that I can't escape it. But, it was right after chat, GPT came out he was being interviewed and it was some question about, where is this leading, isn't it, dangerous? 

And, Sam Altman says something like, yeah, the world is probably gonna end, but there'll be some really, cool companies along the way. And it was like, you psychopaths.

[01:03:39] **JOHN:** Oh yeah.

[01:03:41] **JOSH:** you know, you don't have to do this, you don't have to do it. I do think it's interesting because a lot of these stories that we grew up with I think Babylon 5 holds up, better than most because it was telling a very intentional story about, human nature and how people react to things that unfortunately is timeless as,turning on the news or opening a newspaper will attest to, well actually neither of those things because we don't really do either of those things anymore.

In that way it's just sort oh, my phone says that the world is over. Oh no. 

[01:04:13] **JOHN:** Just says like that, the world's over. I just sent a text. That's it. You get the text, you're like, oh. okay.

[01:04:20] **JOSH:** But, a lot of these shows are dealing with, and I suppose I am thinking about Star Trek in particular, really portraying a. Mid 20th century vision of the future.

That transposes a lot of our conceptions about how we organize society and how we interact with technology in particular.

And also the very idea that the future is out in space,

Right? Like we take that for granted. The idea that the future's in space that's not necessarily the case, but I think it says volumes. That notion is synonymous with the idea of the future. That there will be humans in space and that we will have colonies and we will see other planets and stuff like that.

Which, if you stop when you think about it, that's a very specific 20th century. I would even say 1950s, 1960s specific notion of what the future would be.

[01:05:14] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[01:05:15] **JOSH:** Silicon Valley CEOs also trying to create that vision of the future.

Like, why do you think Elon Musk is so obsessed with, getting to Mars and creating a multi-planetary civilization? It's because he read, foundation when he was 12, and he thinks that's what the future is supposed to be.

[01:05:31] **JOHN:** Yeah. 

Which is so interesting because now that series has its third season coming out. I'm watching that. I've, I, II had read the books years ago and looking at that, that itself was also a novel where space was the way of telling the story and exploring some really cool ideas, but it wasn't aspirational.

Foundation as a series is a anthology. it is a telling of a future history, with its warnings of, of a collapse everything and how to avoid, the worst of that collapse while never being able to avoid the completeness of it. And again, I say well, so what is that motivation?

I watched Star Trek. I thought well, space sounds pretty cool, but the biggest part of the message from that was not only a better world, but it was. Oh, we're going to go solve the mysteries of creation, by exploring. That's a vision I can still very much relate to. That's not the message I'm getting from the CEOs of Silicon Valley.

what it seems to be is entirely based on how can we make more money from this with maybe a marginal improvement to convenience of life. So now you have an Uber, or maybe you have an AI assistant, whatever it is. But it's not solving any of the larger problems.

it's just adding another convenience that has another draw down problem to it on the other side. not say that there aren't any, that, there're gonna be some CEOs who are quite visionary and quite brilliant, in terms of the future. But I'm waiting to see, like with somebody like Musk, it's like, besides getting to Mars, like what is this grand vision for humanity?

Sadly, we know from politics now what that is. It's nothing insightful, impressive. It's actually quite dark and predictable. It's just a view of sadly a view of like, I guess his big thing right now is a neonatal is the idea of, oh, we gotta make sure that certain racial populations have enough children for the future.

And to populate our species or something like that. We're under no actual population collapses that the ones he wants to see in charge may not be reproducing at the rate that he wants. Like, well, that's a terribly retrograde view. I mean, there, there, there's nothing, new about that.

There's nothing particularly insightful, and there's certainly nothing that expands our horizons and goes way out into space and does something with. So he is actually living in like the 19th century or even the 15th century, and I'm like, oh, that's all there is to him. That's really sad. Look, I, II thought there was a grand vision behind his desire to go to Mars.

There was a grand vision behind SpaceX. and there were a lot of people who really assumed that there was something unspoken behind his very successful, very government subsidized, successful companies. And it's a sad thing to realize. I mean, besides the fact that I think he probably bought into it, I mean, Star Trek Discovery tried to make him out as one of the great visionaries of their future

[01:08:22] **JOSH:** god, remember that was only 2017 that episode 

[01:08:27] **JOHN:** 8 years,

[01:08:28] **JOSH:** oh my

[01:08:29] **JOHN:** and how the world has changed how the world,how the world has changed. we, we sometimes lose our heroes in that sense, but It shows the difference between people who are writing or creating things that ask more questions than they answer. And he has very narrow answers. The best shows, the best stories, Babylon 5.

The questions we're asking constantly there. It's not providing all the answers there. You can't create a Babylon 5 Bible that will guide you through all the questions in life. That wasn't the intent of the show. That's not what JMS tries to do in his interactions with fans. It's a constant process of telling stories, asking questions, and giving some hope.

sometimes a difficult hope, but it's not about, well, here, we know everything, and it's all the things you already knew.

[01:09:13] **JOSH:** Exactly. 

just one more thing about Musk. When you think about, if you think about it as literally he read foundation when he was 14, and that's the set of, premises that he's operating under. he thinks that there's a fall coming and he's trying to create technologies that will shorten the

[01:09:35] **JOHN:** The dark Ages.

[01:09:36] **JOSH:** the dark ages that he thinks is inevitable and that he and certain other few will survive which is what the obsession with.

Neonatal and all this really heinous, racist, eugenic, nonsenses I mean, I'm sorry. It's just wild to me that you would care about the rates of like white children being born. It's like the only reason to care about that is if you're racist,

[01:10:01] **JOHN:** Yeah. 

[01:10:01] **JOSH:** like foundationally racist. there's no other reason to care. I mean, as you said, it's not like the human race is dying out far from it. So anyway, Musk fuck that guy. 

[01:10:13] **JOHN:** I wanna say that I read foundation at an older age. I think it was in my late teens or early twenties. And you know what foundation can do to you? And if you miss the cautionary part, or more importantly, you miss the complexity of the stories as they unfold in foundation, is that you really combine to the idea that you're gonna be Harry Seldon, that there's a darkness coming, and that you'll be the one, the shepherd creation through it.

First of all, that doesn't happen in the books. seldon's grand plans all fall apart due to the random components of existence, the mule. 

things, and yes, other people have to use completely other mechanisms to salvage things, and they have to go against much of what thought he knew and thought he predicted.

So, you know what it is? It's just like reading Anne Rand or anybody else. It makes you feel really special about yourself. And the problem is if you grow older from that point and never grow up to where you realize, oh, a, that's not what Harry Seldon was really about, but. B, I'm not gonna be the only one who matters as much as you want that little kid of yourself to be the hero of everything.

and God, what a born story that would be too Babylon 5 pokes fun at that in and of itself because yes, it's written that we have Delen and Sheridan as the protagonists. They are not perfect, but they are really awesome. That's what their characters are and they get constantly beaten down and they survive and create something that endures. And in that future moment, they're deconstructed academically or they really this, they really that. But the point was, in the end comes the inquisitor. They were willing to die in the dark. It wasn't all about them. And that's why they lasted as heroes because they didn't really wanna be the heroes.

They weren't doing it for their own aggrandizement, and they weren't deluded into thinking that was their destiny.

[01:12:04] **JOSH:** Right.

[01:12:04] **JOHN:** It's fun to think about and when you have that sort of still childlike mind, you wanna be that center of everything, but don't grow up to be middle aged CEO and think that's still how it works.

Because all you end up, I mean,sadly, you also sort of end up being a joke once all said and done, but with a lot of destruction and death behind you. I think that's sort of the sad part. the people who end up, thinking in that sort of delusional sense, which is not to say like, go after the great things, do the right thing, be that, but don't expect that everything has to be about you. 

[01:12:40] **JOSH:** this episode reminds me of that the way that this story places our characters, our heroes kind of in the middle of something and they're not necessarily on the side that we want them to be on.

It's a little uncomfortable, particularly when, Garibaldi shows up to, talk to the negotiator they're very antagonistic. the dock workers and garibaldi, and it comes right up close to uh, the tension between law enforcement and the working class, right?

Like, you know, law enforcement is simultaneously thought of as a blue collar job, yet they're also quite often serving the interests of the upper classes, in terms of like who sets the agenda, what their priority is, who they, really serve. And in that moment, because of those dynamics at play, G goes in there and he's kind of the bad guy in that scene, and that's uncomfortable. It's a really uncomfortable thing to watch, and it's a really, daring thing for your show to do. It's an interesting place for your show to go, to risk, making Your character's not the straightforward, righteous ones.

[01:13:50] **JOHN:** Yeah.

The very beginning as Ivanova pushing them.

[01:13:54] **JOSH:** yeah.

[01:13:55] **JOHN:** She has the pressure from the Narns, so she pushes the dog workers, which ultimately leads to the accident. and is that because she's bad? No, she's under the pressure. She's doing her job, but it's not the, she's not the pure, heroic ideal

as a result.

And you want them to be, 

[01:14:10] **JOSH:** So it is interesting. It's because they all are at the mercy of the system that they are operating within. I thought it was really interesting uh, there was that scene the council chamber where they're talking to G'Kar

[01:14:24] **JOHN:** Yes. Yes.

[01:14:25] **JOSH:** and he's saying, you know, my cargo and, the plant and, we want to be compensated for the loss of the property.

And the head of the Docker's union she's like, somebody lost their life, right? And it was all like what did you expect? My captain to do. He was under threatened reacted and blah, blah, blah. And it was just this chain 

each individual action was rational and logical.

[01:14:47] **JOHN:** But taken all together, it led right toward this horrible disaster. And when you look at it that way, at the individual actions, it's like, Okay, well that person over there shouldn't have done that. It's like, yeah, but that's their job. so you, have to land at the conclusion that the problem here must be the way the system is designed.

[01:15:04] **JOSH:** Either something isn't working right or it is working right. And this is how it's designed to work. Which again back to the idea, the way our society is organized. Does it depend on having an underclass whose lives are expendable?

[01:15:22] **JOHN:** Mm-hmm.

[01:15:23] **JOSH:** I mean, I think it does.

[01:15:24] **JOHN:** And it's current iteration and it really does. The show doesn't shy away from that. But the show also is interesting because what you're talking about is sort of what I, in economic terms called the micro on the macro. But I think of,you know, you're talking about the individual decisions versus the system.

And that individual, you're right, every decision was sort of rational, but then its own little,you know, each person's, you know, view in that moment. So you look at the system, but the show also highlights what happens when an individual takes a stand and does something. So that's as the show develops. And when you stand up to President Clark, when you stand up to the Shadows and the Vorlons, when you make the tough calls.

So Sheridan has described a nexus. He's not God, he's not just some morally superior human being, but he is in a unique role that, in which direction he goes, people tend to follow, but not universally. So that's when you have a little bit of, if you wanna call it power, and then you decide what are you going to do.

In the case of B5, he changes the system radically kicks the ancients out, resets that equation for a while. Now it's up to everybody else to do the next step. he's not gonna be, able to do it. He only has 20 years left. this is, that debate is like,are you just gonna say on the individual, oh yes, you're making these rational choices.

You gotta live with what you got. This is the way the system is. Or do you debate the very nature of the system? One could very easily imagine in Babylon 5 that, okay, well dock workers, were being oversight. But why didn't Ivanova, why isn't the policy to say, oh. Sorry, we're at capacity. We can only handle this amount of cargo. That's because the Senate says, we need that station running at this level. You get this amount of cargo through. Oh, but Senate, you didn't provide the funding for it. Make it happen. That's a very common business response in the way that we've ordered our society is to say, oh, even if you don't have a reasonable amount of resources, make it work.

Make people work harder, make them work tougher. And they'll use all kinds of terminology around that. Oh, don't you value work? Aren't you a hard worker? Are you lazy? And, And then all these things come in and they try to make it a moral issue. What it really comes down to is that somebody at some point didn't want the accountability to be somewhere else.

Because if the Senate had granted Babylon 5 more funds, for the dock workers, would that have had any material impact on the budget of the Earth Alliance? No. Would it have improved the quality of life for the workers? Yes. Would it likely have increased the thorough put of how much cargo and commerce can happen in this very unique place, being a station between all these different alien civilizations?

Yeah, probably would've been a net good in the result. but it would've been a challenge to the power dynamic. It would've said, wait, if we don't keep these dock workers low enough, people say, oh, then you gotta give to everybody. No. I think the real danger to those people is

then they're gonna be affirmed as mere equals to me and I can't have that. That was, I think, why the senator had that line. Oh, my grandfather was a dock worker. That's meant to actually portray not sympathy. He thinks he's portraying sympathy. It's meant to show, I understand it, but I'm above it now.

[01:18:25] **JOSH:** Right. Yeah. so it also shows that what's progress is getting away from that.

[01:18:31] **JOHN:** Right.

Not solving 

[01:18:33] **JOSH:** Right. He did that so that his grandchildren wouldn't have to do that. the other thing it doesn't strike me like there's really anyone in the Senate to advocate for

the position of the dock workers. And it speaks to, the separation between the lived experience of the people in the Senate and the lived experience of the dock workers on the ground. You know, was that line that you quoted our experts say you have enough money, blah, blah, blah.

Eduardo, the lead, dock workers says something, well, I'd like to see your experts, come down here and work a shift on the,docking bay. And it's just that when you're removed from the actual experience, knowing how it,actually works, 

Not in theory, how it works. It's like, well, if they can do this in this amount of time, then that means that they must be to do this andthat amount of time. Right? it's not how it works. And they don't know that that's not how it works because they're not interested enough to find out.

Noticing some parallels here. if you don't want to know, then you don't have to care.

[01:19:33] **JOHN:** Yeah, I mean, that's one of the core rules of how most of our societies in this planet function is that, you keep yourself unaware and ignorant of that because it might otherwise make you feel a little bit responsible or a little bit,

[01:19:48] **JOSH:** You might have to confront some things about how things work and maybe you are 

[01:19:54] **JOHN:** That's so interesting because I was thinking at it from the other angle, but you're right. So that's the angle that appeals to it's not empathy. I've been moving away from some of the definitions of that word because now so contentious as it is, but the idea of if one has empathy or compassion for another, it becomes much harder to maintain your actions when you see that the consequences of what you're doing or lack of knowledge about what they're doing hurts them. I was thinking about it that, well, what if we peel the pragmatic side? I think both are really necessary for those that have empathy, for those that have a sense of caring about fellow human beings, expanding out that awareness helps.

On the flip side, for those that. Are a little bit too jaded, a little bit too cynical on that. Well, there's the other side. If you ignore the humanity, the concerns and the dignity of people long enough, eventually those people will turn to a pretty dangerous leader. That's something we see in history repeatedly.

you saw it predominantly with fascist leaders in the past who start their rise to power typically from workers' parties. Now very quickly turn on those workers. Those workers end up at the same bottom rung they were at. But now there's a new national identity, there's a new power base, and it's quite brutal.

Obviously Italy and Germany, the early 20th centuries are these like prime examples, but it's repeated itself numerous times. And the comparison to today is that the current administration, the president came in on a campaign of grievance, but a lot of valid grievances. And he went to a working class in particular that has been ignored, derided, and I mean just wrecked by every administration, Democrat or Republican, across the political spectrum, across businesses. So somebody claims they have an answer for them. Now from the outside, we know those answers aren't gonna work. Those answers don't even apply to their problems. Nothing that is the current position is doing is going to increase the quality of life or the dignity. Of the frustrated voters, who voted for it, at least from the workers, camp, but at least I feel like it was somebody directly addressing that grievance.

And that's what, that's the vulnerability that our society always faces. That if you're gonna take this sort of milk toast approach to incremental progress and say we don't really have the money in the budget this year. The president of the Earth Alliance doesn't have the political clout to do the right thing right now.

Well, Did you try, did you really give it a try? Or did you just write it off as well? The numbers didn't make sense for this year. And you do that this year, then you do it the next year. You do it the year after 10 years have passed, the workers' conditions go down, and all of a sudden somebody comes out with grievance and says, okay, you've been ignored for 10 years.

I'll give you a better option. Go after this pe these other group of people. That's really the reason why your life is miserable, further inflaming those tribal differences. And at the end of that populist, path, there's never salvation. But the people following at least somebody hears them in this episode.

It wasn't until the end that somebody heard the dock workers, Sinclair does, Garibaldi shakes their hand and basically like, yeah, no, let's come to an agreement on this. not press charges. So the real answer as to why that was done is that, Sinclair manipulates the system, gives him something.

Was it the final story? Was it everything they needed? Probably nowhere near that. But to be seen, to watch somebody fight for you and to turn the system on itself to get you something of what you need the goodwill that buys is extraordinary. That's something that we have will documented history and labor movements for.

And I don't think modern politicians in our world are yet ready to acknowledge that reality again. which we have in the past at different points, which is to say you have to not only pay lip service, but you have to take whatever action you can even if you're not solving all the problems, in one shot. And if you don't do so, it's gonna be your political career at peril, ultimately, to a much more powerful populist force that could go in any direction and could do anything like a whirlwind.

[01:24:16] **JOSH:** You know, That leads me to one final thing that I wanted to say. Couple episodes ago, or last episode. I said something at the end about, if there's anyone listening to please reach out and send us an email or, contact us. And, uh, did, a listener named Ellen, who wrote us a very lovely email, which I think I speak for both of us when I say that, you know, made me feel good and like what we're doing here is kind of worthwhile.

It's Knowing someone is hearing what we're talking about and they're connecting with it, and maybe seeing some of, their concerns or values reflected in our conversation, maybe not feeling as alone. But, um, one of the things that she, happened to mention uh, one of her favorite quotes from the entire series was from this episode.

there were no happily ever afters, just new battles. Which is kind of like what you're describing here. It's yes, at the end the Good guys, quote unquote win, it's a quote unquote happy ending. But you're right. They didn't get everything that they needed, but, they got some, and more importantly, they saw someone was fighting for them.

And that's the ending they have to live with for today so they can survive to fight another day. Um, and yeah, I think implicit in that line there are no happily ever afters just new battles. For me, at least, the era of Trump I found that to be very true because we are fighting a lot of fights tooth and nail that I thought were long ago.

One.

[01:25:47] **JOHN:** Yes. Settled. Settled things.

[01:25:49] **JOSH:** So many things. And I think that's really true. The work of, whatever you wanna call it, government or the work of um, just being a force for good in the world it's never done. It's never, you know, mission accomplished.

Okay, we won. Now let's all go home and never think about this again. It's constant the work,

[01:26:09] **JOHN:** Yeah. by the way, that's not a dark or a downward perspective.

it can be interpreted that way. But I've always thought of as well, life doesn't just stop and go into stasis. The idea of a happily ever after, the idea of just putting the point sort of means that what happens after is, is that the battles continue.

I, I've always thought of it like when you hear the concept of the, of the joyful or the happy warrior, you're not fighting out of anger or just fighting because it's, it's miserable. You're saying yesterday's challenge was yesterday's challenge. Today's challenge is today's challenge.

And to not sit in stasis as if you accomplished one thing, and that's the totality of life, because that would also be kind of sad. it's like the war hero who has no more battles to fight and just keeps on reliving that one victory. And it's like, well, what are you doing with the rest of your life?

So you win one great struggle and you pick up the next thing and say, but how can we next improve ourselves? I think that's the ideal vision of science fiction. You're not locked into stasis. You were moving forward all the time and your destination keeps on getting updated. The negative is when you do have to deal with a constant onslaught of difficult things and you hope to at least get a respite.

And I think that's what we need, like this, at least the small victories here and there that say, ah, what you're doing does have purpose, even if it doesn't work every day.

[01:27:34] **JOSH:** Yeah.

[01:27:35] **JOHN:** And then you have the strength to keep going.

[01:27:38] **JOSH:** Yeah. you know, Which also really makes me think about the structure of the series. They achieve their goals that we all assumed, you know, was gonna be the end point of the series, the victory over the shadows, and also the liberation of Earth and the resolution of the year of Civil War.But

the show is still interested in what happens once you've won.

[01:28:00] **JOHN:** Yeah. Even as it's maligned for other aspects. The fifth season explores a lot of interesting. Concepts around that, especially as it gets into its final, arc. And that's why, A, there are always more stories to be told. Uh, we're never done. And then I guess b, that it means that it continues, but it's not a bad thing.

Sheridan and Delin had more stuff to do. They had more life to live. And as a result, they continued to grow as people. They continued to have more experiences together. that to me is a good story. And a very, hopeful one. It's, a lot tougher if it's just, well, they won, they beat the shadows.

We're done. Let's turn off the camera, turn off the lights. We're done. 

[01:28:40] **JOSH:** Yeah. And I also think it's more relatable. It's more true to life, uh, because, you know, when you have your whatever version of a, hard won victory, or, you know, you do the thing, you graduated, you got the job, you finished the project, you did it.

You still wake up the next morning and you have to figure out what to do next.

[01:29:02] **JOHN:** Yeah.

[01:29:03] **JOSH:** Yeah. There were no happily ever afters, just new battles. I agree with you. it's not a downer. it should be. Kind of inspiring or at least invigorating.

[01:29:14] **JOHN:** That's a good word. Invigorating.

[01:29:15] **JOSH:** Yeah. Yeah, it's a really interesting episode. I love that the show is just as concerned with the experience of Dockers as it is the first sentt life in the galaxy.

[01:29:28] **JOHN:** And it's not the only episode like this. I mean, as we discussed, like, uh, the,down below lurks are integral to the stories in the future, but also you see their perspectives a lot. And of course the fifth season does a brilliant episode. One of the be I thought was actually one of the better episodes in some ways where it's entirely from the perspective of the maintenance workers who are constantly fixing the station in between the battles, the disasters or the everyday things.

and just see that perspective and say yes, this is what is also happening. And they are as much the heroes as the main characters. it's a really cool, thing. and that's why I think, uh.the show stands out, for Star Trek, it took lower deck speed to really get a sense of the lower decks, which I'm so grateful for.

but there were always questions in a lot of other sci-fi. What is it like on the lower decks? What is it like for everybody else, and what are those struggles beyond just the grand, battle, not the tout? I think the other, the other,show you focus a lot on your podcast Andor, goes into the grittiness of what it is to fight as well when you aren't just the heroic figures.

So that's why I think shows like this are always appealing to me because they give you the hero, they give you the things you really want from a story. But it's not limited to that. It's not just giving you the hero. This isn't just one perspective. We're getting the whole picture and we're seeing how complex it is and how sometimes, the heroes don't get fulfilled.

I mean, Sinclair gets beaten up and as JMS says, even in his comments, like, he's beaten up for 48 hours straight from all sides, no one's happy. And in the end, he does earn the respect of the dock workers. But now he has new enemies in the shadows somewhere, not the actual shadows in the politicians and businessmen of the Earth Alliance.

So it's like, oh man, the poor guy just gets, beaten up on all sides all the time. What is he gonna do? And he keeps on going.

[01:31:18] **JOSH:** You think Elon Musk ever watched Babylon 5?

[01:31:22] **JOHN:** I almost don't wanna know the answer to that question, but I don't think so. there's nothing that I've come across that has anything he's shared that has either been from the show or has been an idea that is very clearly from the show. It's always been something that's specifically to other, science fiction. but I wouldn't bet money one way or the other on it. I just, that's my feeling because he's never talked about the grander issues, or issues in that sort of grand idea of, oh what does this mean in terms of whether it's authoritarianism or, I don't know, Shadows and Vorlons.

there's just nothing. There's nothing that's been there for that. And he is never spoken as if he's ever interacted with somebody who isn't well off. he certainly has not shown any indication of that. So I don't think he knows that people exist. He certainly wouldn't know that dock workers exist, except his intellectual abstraction.

[01:32:20] **JOSH:** My head cannon is people were wearing him down. Wearing 'em down. He finally gave it a shot and he, started watching it, and then he got to this episode and he gave up after this one because it's just not for him.

[01:32:30] **JOHN:** I could see that 

[01:32:31] **JOSH:** all right. We will be back at some point in the uh, not too distant future. I think we're sort of at a point where, we were saying before we started recording like, when we started this, the episodes we naturally gravitated toward because of what was going on in the real world.

It was some really pretty one-to-one parallels where it was very clear, you know, whatwe should watch next, or what we should be talking about. And it's not that things have improved really, but real world events aren't mapping one-to-one to the show.

So I think from here on out we're gonna jump around and cover episodes that we sort of feel like watching. And then I suppose if something happens and there's a very 

[01:33:15] **JOHN:** clear corollary. We could,jump in. Uh.certainly. I think that were last recording you is like the one-to-one, at least in the US system, the president's power is at their peak in the first a hundred days, typically speaking. And it makes sense that would be the most of it.

Now, that doesn't mean to lull anybody into a false sense of complacency. Three and a half years left full power of the executive branch at his disposal. But what did happen, which is where it diverges from the show, is in the show, the core of resistance is the station, the outer colonies, which are very low population to keep that in mind.

And the events were moving towards the Shadow, Vorlon war. And our timeline, that the pushback has been quite real. Has it been successful and stopping the thing? No, but it's been real. And there's a battle every next day. The battles are still happening.

People are pushing back today, tomorrow, and not every day is a victory. But because of that, it stopped the momentum. I don't think we're at the point of momentum that he had in February, March and April, which seemed like a juggernaut without any stopping. Now that giant machine of the executive branch is still going fast, unrestrained by a collaborative Congress.

The Supreme Court at the seems hellbent on dismantling anything, uh, liberal or progressive within the government. But it's slower. And I think as long as people keep going there's something. Now that could also be, that the show does show that there's a brief resistance to President Clark.

And very quickly is sort of, put out, if that's the difference we face. that's where the stories diverge. that's where the, slow part happens. The parallel I would draw is that's when you realize there's a resistance to Clark, but it's much quieter. And that's when second half of season three into season four is unfolding.

As you see, what is the day-to-day like? How are people trying to get through it? How are people, resisting in the ways that they can, um, but.we will see as I said, I hope we don't do a actual Severed Dreams episode of, well, that's what's happening right now. because I think that will be quite scary, uh, in and of itself.

But who knows? There's so many more lessons, from the show. That's the point, is it's a it's a inquiry, uh, into dialogue. And there's a lot to learn about how to do that maybe in some small way. The reason things are a little bit different now is because people are taking the idea not from our tiny little show, or not just from Babylon 5but they're saying, Hey, if you keep on fighting those battles, that's the point.

You don't know what the outcome will be, but you gotta keep it, gotta keep it going. And that's what I see today is that people are standing up. has it stopped ice in la? No. Has it maybe slowed it down? Maybe? Has it changed the thought around it? Yes, because the polling data of the sentiment of the US population has seen a seismic shift. The seismic shift is from a massively anti-immigrant perspective of a sort of view when polled in the American people a year ago to a near pro-immigrant perspective. Now that's being polled. that is seismic. That's a fundamental shift. Even if we don't have the power to stop. What the government is doing with a massively empowered new amount of money going into ice. It tells you that's what happens. and that's what happened to B5 was it wasn't winning battles every day. It wasn't, oh, we just have the technology to defeat the shadows overnight. He was cobbling together these alliances, cobbling other people, and slowly winning people over on ideas.

And it's, God, it's a grueling process and it's a frustrating process. It must be, that's what Sheridan was losing his mind at the end of season three. uh, Trying to get people on board just to acknowledge the threat of the shadows. So that, I think, is itself a huge victory that if the polling data is correct and the American perspective has shifted on not only the idea of immigration, but the dignity of immigrants themselves, things are already changing.

Again, three and a half years. A lot left to be known. But that to me is very hopeful.

[01:37:25] **JOSH:** Yeah, no, I agree. The other thing too, morale among ICE agents is incredibly low, because they know that they're reviled. I think some of them, joined for whatever reason. But I also think that they're having, real experiences that, Are unpleasant 

in terms of the work that they are being asked to carry out. So I think from all sides it's probably, not a fun time for them. And good.

[01:37:55] **JOHN:** Yeah, that's a successful method of resistance. I'm trying to remain serious right now, I have a dog demanding my attention.

[01:38:01] **JOSH:** Yeah. All right. We are lastbesthopeb5@gmail.com . Please reach out and write us an email. We're gonna be more on social media at some point if and when we are lastbesthopeB5. And we'll see you next time.
